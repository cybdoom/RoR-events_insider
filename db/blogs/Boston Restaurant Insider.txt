<p>Don't complain about the heat. Boston is so cold generally that any day with sun is a blessing. But the day I arrived at Angora Cafe was punishing. After a long walk, I immediately sat stunned on the full-length sofa, not feeling human. Then manager Turkan Caglar got me a mango smoothie and I was transformed. Any chilled drink will cool you down with a price to pay -- the chemical syrupy taste from the smoothie counter at the mall or McDonald's non-dairy shakes. I waited to feel sick, but it didn't happen. Instead I felt healed, loved, energized.</p>

<p>This is the wholesome goodness behind Angora Cafe, an American cafe with a touch of the Mediterranean. And it was inspired in part by Siemens, the widget maker behind car parts and power systems. "I was an electrical engineer at Siemens," explained Turkan, "working at a factory that served breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 24 hours a day. Then I came from Turkey to Boston ten years ago and was surprised that I couldn't find the same foods here, healthy and nutritious foods without the extra calories."</p>

<p>Owner Selim Gurel sees the same problem. "I have two kids and it's easy to find fast food, but hard to find something quick that's also healthy," he says. Having worked at Angora Cafe, he bought it twenty years ago from its original 1985 founder and has run it since. "We're the alternative to regular fast foods." he says. For example, they bake their falafels, which is rare in the business. Unlike my favorite Middle Eastern hole in the wall, Falafel Palace in Cambridge, their only grill is their panini sandwich grill, and they don't use oil or grease.</p>

<p>According to Turkan, their flat bread pizza comes with 350-500 calories a slice, served on low-carb wheat tortillas. Pizza as health food? I don't believe it.</p>

<p>It sounds too good to be true: good-tasting foods that are nutritious, low-calorie, inexpensive, and convenient. Just try the hippie-fantastic Fresh City, whose prices are a little too high, or shop at Whole Foods, whose organic products are hardly heart-healthy. Studies have shown that foods grown organically aren't really any better for you (although they may sometimes be better for the environment).</p>

<p>Five minutes later, I believe it.</p>

<p>The mango smoothie has no bitterness and no aftertaste. There's nothing phony about the mix of kiwi, honey, lemon sorbet, and orange juice. The artichoke and roasted garlic flat bread pizza isn't on 3 millimeter pita pocket bread. The 1 millimeter substrate barely exists, and there's just a sprinkling of feta cheese. I generally order a pizza with pineapple topping so it's not dry, and ask for half the cheese, and it still turns out too cheesy. At Angora Cafe, the artichoke and garlic add some juice and the cheese doesn't overwhelm.</p>

<p>"We listen to feedback," says Selim. "That's our secret. Most of our managers have been here for 8 years or more and we take the time to get to know our customers and make food the way they like it." Perhaps that's why Angora is so popular, a "find" that all the locals know about. Situated on the Boston University campus, their customers are mainly students, but they have a family corner with a chalkboard for kids and childrens' menu, and a catering business that serves hospitals, schools, businesses, and sports teams as well. The place is small -- it seats about 20 -- but well-lit, clean, and uplifting. There's a happy energy to the customers who come in.</p>

<p>Although Angora Cafe may try a little too hard -- I don't believe in New Agey gimmicks like "nutrition packs" in smoothies that supposedly detoxify you -- you don't have to eat sitting lotus style to appreciate what they offer. The frozen yogurt comes from an all-natural supplier, so it doesn't come from a powder base (but it tasted the same to me) and they have a sugar-free soy alternative. Their raspberry filled cookies are a chunk of heaven, without the toughness of the storebought types you normally get -- and it's unusual to find innovative ideas like brownie-filled cookies. </p>

<p>The turco panini, a flat grilled sandwich with turkish spices, is too heavy on the cheese, but has mayonnaise to offset the dryness. And it comes with sausage chunks that taste like meat, not like the pepperoni-thin circles you find at pizza shops that are barely meat at all. Of course, any sandwich squashed to half the size is bound to be somewhat heavy.</p>

<p>Terms like "organic" or "clean eating" may not mean anything real, but Angora Cafe makes a real home for its customers, with student-sized pricing but without a hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. Their menu gives nutrition information, and while they don't serve serious breakfast or dinner food, you could have a wrap, pizza, salad, panini, smoothie, or frozen yogurt here anytime. And they are opening a new branch called Angora Ice in Chestnut Hill. You arrive weary. You leave transformed.</p>

<p>It's about the meat. I've only ever had dreams about one restaurant -- the Midwest Grill in Cambridge -- for their glorious, vegetarian crippling meats. But I think I'll be dreaming about Garlic 'n Lemons soon, which also cooks using vertical broilers open to view. They were my favorite at the recent Taste of Allston, and I've been looking forward to visiting in person.</p>

<p>The Lebanese restaurant just opened in April, but the family has been in the business for years. The founder of the restaurant, Rosie Helvadjian helped grow Aceituna Cafe, in Kendall Square, Cambridge, and gained quite a following there. But the owner didn't want to franchise, and thus, she started her own location.</p>

<p>"Cooking is my life." She says. "If I don't cook, I have no life." Her sons chime in with similar enthusiasm. "I told my wife I'm married to this business for 5 years", says Marty, who just returned from training in South Lebanon. Was that before or after the wedding vows? I wonder, but the thought doesn't last long. It's knocked out of me by the food.</p>

<p>"If you don't love cooking, you can't do anything." Rosie tells me confidently, while she makes sure that I'm eating and eating. Far from being awkward, it's comforting that she's a sort of mother as well to me and her customers.</p>

<p>The beef & lamb shawerma -- that call it spicy beef but it's really "sujek", an armenian sausage -- is the best, freshest meat I've had in ages and needs no topping. But it comes with rice, salad, and lemon. There's also a unnecessary garlic dip for the meats, which is creamy but not too rich.</p>

<p>I also tried the "mloukhieh", which is jute leaves & cilantro with chicken over rice, with onions & vinegar with pita chips. There's nothing deep fried here and the taste is natural, wholesome, rather than the result of too many spices or sauces. Again, the meat is juicy and not too fatty. You're left with a great combination: food that's international and exotic, but also accessible and not demandingly strange.</p>

<p>Although not a hole-in-the-wall, the location is small and has no table service. But that just means no additional cost for tipping, and they've got lower prices than the Middle Eastern places I'm familiar with. It seats fewer than 20 people, and while they don't have real napkins -- just the brown paper towels you see in public restrooms -- the environment is clean, upbeat, brightly lit, and homey. You wouldn't be embarassed to bring a date there, as long as it wasn't your first date.</p>

<p>Although there's a television in the corner, there isn't a sports bar feel, and the place is quiet, with no music playing. The main noise is the refrigerator of cold drinks. They've got drinks you won't find elsewhere, like Vimto, a fruit drink that a lot of foreign students ask for. Again, it's exotic but accessible. It tastes like root beer. </p>

<p>"We have daily specials to change up the menu", Rosie tells me, and although I can't eat anything more, she twists my arm and I try a small bite of osmalia. Ten seconds later I have eaten the whole thing. It's a dessert with filo dough, a creme filling, and a brittle topping, a combination of soft and crunchy that makes a great mouth feel. It tastes honey soaked, but not too sweet. That's not honey, it's rose water, Rosie says. I've got to get me some of this rose water.</p>

<p>Garlic 'n Lemons has a full menu, with the Middle Eastern foods you'd expect: falafel, kebabs, grape leaves, meat pies, couscous, and hummus. But you can also get an eggplant on your kebab, with soup and french fries. They also provide buffet style catering. Unfortunately, they don't have a website yet, but you can follow them on Facebook and Twitter, and pick up a takeout menu at their location.</p>

<p>There's no way I can eat any more, but I find myself allowing Rosie to serve me a rollup with a spicy hamburger called "kefta", which is served with cheese. They've also got a vegetarian version with olives and oregano. Again, it's to die for. She seems satisfied by my appreciation. "I make that cheese in here", she says with maternal pride, which tells you all you need to know about Garlic 'n Lemons.</p>

<p>When you think pizzeria, you think the Mediterranean, and it's usually Italian or Greek. There's some Italian in Inbound Pizza , but a lot of Turkish as well, right next to where UNO Pizzeria used to be in Allston.</p>

<p>Since 1975 it's been a family business, and you get what you expect. There's no table service but they feature an enormous menu of subs, sandwiches, pizzas, roll-ups, and salads, all with coupon discounted in their menu. You can even get exotic toppings like shrimp, garlic, and jalapeno peppers on your pizza. Often in the summer I choose a restaurant solely based on whether they have frozen yogurt. Inbound Pizza does. Plus they offer breakfast, mainly omelets and rollups, and specialty foods, like Turkish baklavas and shawermas. I sampled a "Doner", an imported yogurt drink that's clearly an acquired taste, because it tastes like sour milk to my Yankee sensibility.</p>

<p>Despite the unusual food, I regret to say that the atmosphere and the food were ordinary. They have a vertical broiler for meat but the pizza I sampled was greasy. I tried a turkish panini that was heavy with too much cheese, and the sausage, sliced thin like pepperoni, got lost.</p>

<p>The decor is ordinary, with seating for 30, and although it was recently painted, there are cracks in the floor and no style to the interior design. In all, despite the Turkish theme, it's a typical neighborhood pizzeria that does not stand out.</p>

<p>Let's make it clear from the start: they're not married! Co-owners Gloria carpio and Tito Nieves also bring different perspectives to the business. She loves to cook and ran a cleaning business before founding El Taqueria Carrizal in 2007, partly as an excuse to stay close to her daughter and son as they grew up. Tito came in to help six months ago as the business grew and works with computers during the day for a charity.</p>

<p>Born in Guatemala, Gloria brings the foods of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador to the restaurant, with an edge that's authentic, not dumbed down for Bostonians -- but it's not as hard core at Tu Y Yo in Somerville. Gloria loves to cook, but it's Tito who loves to talk.</p>

<p>"Don't spread this around," he says, "but I'm actually Puerto Rican." But he clearly knows the food and has a knack for business. They serve liquor and have just installed wireless Internet for their customers. Locals come and stay all day, buying drinks, enjoying the air conditioning, and watching soccer on their television. So it's a bit of a sports bar as well. "People want to come not just to eat but to socialize," Tito tells me. Soups are popular on Sundays, and you can get a "pupusas", appetizer tortillas with pork & cheese, for just $2 each.</p>

<p>Local is the word for this place. This sit-down restaurant is solid in all areas, but really meant for the local central americans who are already comfortable with the food. They serve free chips and salsa, and you can get shrimp, beef, chicken fajita, american style. But most of the dishes will not be familiar to the average customer.</p>

<p>The Montanero is their most popular dish, and it's their only one from Colombian cuisine. To me, the pork rind was too tough and fatty to get through, and the steak was not bad but not exciting either. It was a little too tough, which probably makes it more authentic, I suppose. I loved the plaintains -- who doesn't dream of adding monster bananas to their food -- and my favorite dish was the Camarones a la Diabla: Shrimp of the Devil.</p>

<p>First off, who wouldn't like a meal called Shrimp of the Devil. It's a shrimp soup served with rice and beans and salad. It was spicy and unusual. They also have some ethnic imported drinks, and I tried La Cascada, a cream soda from El Salvador, which was great, natural tasting and refreshing with no aftertaste. I also tried a Jarritos: a lime flavored soda, that was not too sweet and an interesting citrus tang that was not chemical.</p>

<p>Of course their most popular take-out food, in the student universe that is allston, is burritos. And they provide catering services to local groups as well. You can get a variety of vegetarian foods as well.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, though generic, is a clean attractive environment. Notably their aquarium was empty when I visited. "Our cleaner, the guy who came to clean the tank out, put the fish in a temporary bag and then, they were gone." Tito tells me. They stole your fish? I'm sure they'll have some new fish there soon. I would guess that it easily seats 50 people.</p>

<p>Like the atmosphere, my take on the food is that it's solid, attractive -- look at the great presentation in the photos! -- but generic. The pupusa is not gresy but it's also uninteresting, the sauce was so mild that it made no difference. That being said, El Taqueria Carrizal serve huge portions. Every meal that I saw would feed two people.</p>

<p>Tito sat with me while I ate, and like always when owners do this to me, there's always an uncomfortable moment at the end where, even though he doesn't say anything, I feel like I'm supposed to give him some verbal clues as to what I'm going to write. "Have you noticed that the food is a little bland?" I venture.</p>

<p>"I get that all the time", says Tito. Apparently, spicy food is a Mexican concept, not a Central American concept. "We make it bland for everybody, but then you make it as spicy as you want by adding sauces." That sounds reasonable, but at the same time, somehow I feel a little alienated by this. Isn't mixing and matching the spices in a unique way important to ethnic cooking?</p>

<p>Ultimately, I don't doubt that El Taqueria Carrizal is a big hit with those who know the cuisine or are daring enough to accept something new that doesn't pander to Norte Americano tastes. But to me it's a little like art films made for artists. Although I'll give the restaurant a solid mid-level review, what's more accurate is that if you're looking for something comfortable from the old country, this is the restaurant for you! If you're looking for an exotic cuisine to sample foreign lands, this is probably not your restaurant. In other words, just what the owners and their loyal locals are aiming for.</p>

<p>It's not authentic if it's not authentic. Owner Tom Shin makes the case to me over lunch. There are plenty of Korean restaurants in Greater Boston, he tells me, but most of them think they're not viable financially unless they cater to Americans (who don't want it so spicy) or Chinese (who want it sweeter).</p>

<p>It's an attitude I can get behind, at first. The restaurant is huge, seating at least 100 people, with a stylish bamboo interior and built-in hot plates on some of the tables. The menu has steakhouse pricing and gives all the signs that this is the upscale place to be. The only concession to refinement is a beer sign in the window.</p>

<p>Tom moved here from Korea in the 1970s and, after school, helped his parents with their home business, a clothing store, for 22 years. But the business wasn't a huge moneymaker and so in late 2008 he opened this restaurant with the following style: they won't alter the food. It's also the reason that the lowest priced lunch special is $9. He'd rather raise the price on the menu than lower the quality of the food.</p>

<p>Fair enough. They seem to do a good job of it. They serve a special every month, like a whole chicken hen, stuffed with ginseng. Tom's cook is from New York and travels there regularly to keep up on the latest trends in Korean cuisine. And Tom is particularly proud of his "banchan", a combination plate of appetizers.</p>

<p>Like a steakhouses serve bread and Mexican places serve chips, Korean restaurants typically serve banchan but hold it until the last minute, so you can't ask for refills. At Korean Garden & Restaurant, the banchan comes out right away. It's expensive but a way of seducing customers into becoming regulars.</p>

<p>I don't review restaurants for food critics to read. This is not theoretical to me, like I'm trying to prove to you I'm a man of the world. I prefer to give it to you straight as a regular guy, so you can actually decide where to eat. So here is my regular guy take on the banchan: it's strange. The 12 side dishes include radish, parsley, beans, kimchi, anchovies, and, seeming out of place, sliced hot dogs with peppers. I try a bunch and it's good tasting in the "Is this good tasting?" mode you have to be in when you try a completely foreign food. The fish egg soup's pretty good, though. Banchan is zesty and spicy, and the fresh vegetables have a good crunch to them.</p>

<p>Notably, I left the anchovies alone, but Tom -- I need to find a way to get the owners not to sit and stare at me while I try to review their food -- makes me eat some. "What kind of reviewer are you? Eat the anchovies!" he says in a friendly tone. I pick one up. It's about an inch and a half long, with sad little eyes. I've never eaten an animal's head and eyes before. Tom looks at me expectantly. I eat it.</p>

<p>It's tough, like chewing through beef jerky. Poor little anchovy! I think.</p>

<p>I try a seafood clam soup with tofu, which Tom tells me is popular with the Chinese crowd. It's spicy & interesting, the consistency of tofu, but in a soup. I'm half-way through it when I wonder what kind of meat tastes so chewy and has stubble on it. It's squid.</p>

<p>I've got nothing against squid conceptually, although I hope when scientists some day learn to speak with them that they forgive the human race, but it's not an enjoyable chew either. The texture is all wrong to my non-Korean sensibility. It's not my intention to be disrespectful of other cultures. But I admit it. I didn't really "get" or enjoy the meal either. Is it disrepectful to say that meat shouldn't be too tough or too chewy with puckers?</p>

<p>Unfortunately it's indicative of the other food I tried. Everything comes in a broth. Sam Gae Tangis a hen with rice and ginseng, tasting like baked chicken, but having been boiled whole, picking the meat off is tricky. Kalbi Tang are short ribs, also in broth, but don't think barbecue ribs. Having been stewed, the ribs taste very tender, very much like a stew, and served boiling hot. Tom informs me that the meat is all fresh, not frozen, and they make all their sauces in house except the soy sauce.</p>

<p>It's impossible to fault a restaurant that serves Ganjang Gaejang, a crab meal, where they refuse to use raw blue crabs unless they're pregnant with eggs. It just sounds like Tom and his staff know exactly what they are doing. But when it comes to not bending to suit broad tastes, I'm afraid to say that they succeeded. One of the perqs of restaurant reviews is that after sampling 4-5 dishes, there's always something to take home for later. For the first time, there's nothing I want to take home from a restaurant here.</p>

<p>So if you're not Korean, but you're looking for something exotic, start with the more accessible fare at other Korean restuarants. Perhaps later you can graduate to the authentic, upscale, and well-crafted cuisine at Korean Garden & Restaurant.</p>

<p>When Sukhwinder Singh tells me, "I love to cook", of course I've heard that before. Then the manager of India Pavilion excuses himself while I wait for my food. After making some notes, I look through the large glass window into the kitchen, and even though he has a full staff on duty, he's the one making my food, dressed in a crisp, flawless business suit.</p>

<p>Apparently, he loves to cook.</p>

<p>There are a lot of semi-upscale Indian places in Cambridge and Boston, but this is a step above and it's not an accident. Singh's father-in-law owns three restaurants, all with a different focus. Haveli in Cambridge, formerly Akbar India, is for casual dinners. Punjabi Dhaba is a quick bite self-service take out shop. And India Pavilion is their full service restaurant with real decor.</p>

<p>It works. The place is upscale, romantic, and dimly lit, but the prices are moderate. The entrees are all $10-$13. They serve wine and beer but their bar is hidden in the back where it doesn't take over the restaurant feel of the place, and it seats 100. It's perfect for a casual lunch, business meeting, or date.</p>

<p>Singh was a computer engineer in India, but married into the family and came to the USA, learning the business and how to cook from his father-in-law. He swears the restaurant is authentic to his home country, and they've also dared to go beyond what I've seen at Indian places: it can be healthy. Healthy?</p>

<p>Sure, Singh says. For example, they have a vegetarian menu, and serve tandoori shrimp! It's delightful and comes with tomato, lemon, lettuce, mint, and yogurt. It's cleaned, so a fork food, not a finger food. They have tandoori fish, too. What an original idea.</p>

<p>Tandoor cooking takes all the fat out of the meat, by melting it away. And customers can ask can substitute white meat for dark meat. They use 2% milk in their yogurt, and vegetable oil instead of butter in their curries. I'm not sure I buy it, but I want healthy Indian food too much to look closely. And partly the proof is in the eating. It's not greasy. At Indian restaurants, there's usually a stage of regret that follows delicious. You are safe from that at India Pavilion.</p>

<p>The lamb curry left a delightful burning in my mouth, and I tried masala lemonade, which comes with black pepper and salt. It has no pulp and is well blended into a single substance, which makes it too smooth and perfect, like gatorade, but it's another example of ethnic cuisine that's distinctive, interesting, but accessible. That's indicative of the entire restaurant, and they cook for anyone's taste. Just order your meal mild, spicy, or medium, which is the default.</p>

<p>Unusual meals include the West Indies jerk chicken, which is a chicken curry with jerk sauce. It's rich, really spicy and tender, with a plain substrate of rice that's a nice balance. They say to get the hot out of your mouth, don't drink water, which just spreads it around. Eat rice or some of the peshawa bread, which is sweet.</p>

<p>Or try some raita, a homemade yogurt, that's creamy but not sweet like the yogurt's you find in the grocery store. It's more like a cole slaw sauce or a salad dressing. The restaurant is full of such discoveries, including Indian beer and wine, goat curry masala, and even lobster tikka masala!</p>

<p>An Indian restaurant with seafood? At reasonable prices? In a great atmosphere? Just steps from the subway? And that offers a daily lunch buffet?</p>

<p>You had me at seafood.</p>

<p>Here's a fun fact about Amara Restaurant: it's not Ethiopean. It's Eritrean.</p>

<p>"But of course, it's Ethiopean, too." says Lettensa Afeworki, the owner who opened the place in Cambridge in 1986, before the area's other Ethiopean restaurant, Addis Red Sea. Eritrea was part of Ethiopea before independence and they share the same culture. They were also once a colony of Italy! So the original menu at Amara was half Italian food such as spaghetti and meatballs. "But people just laughed at us," Lettensa says. "We had to remove that part of the menu."</p>

<p>The place is a midclass restaurant, and there's nothing outstanding about its decor. It's bright and the lighting is basic, with overhead fluorescent bulbs like it's an office. It seats 47 indoors and has outdoor seating in warm weather.</p>

<p>The list of entrees is small: there are 14 of them, between $13 and $16, which fits on one page, like the beer and wine list. But you don't really go to Asmara for the entrees, at least not the first time. You go for the combination meal, which include shrimp, chicken, lamb, and collard green salad.</p>

<p>It's an experience. First you're served a hot towel (you know that hot water is not enough to sanitize your hands, right?), and then served a giant family-style platter with tappas-sized dishes on a huge layer of bread called injeria. Their bread is fermented in water overnight and is gluten-free, making it a favorite for those with wheat allergies. You get bread on the side, too, and you eat without utensils, by scooping the food up in slices of bread. The bread is like a very soft pita bread, easy to chew and which readily falls apart in your hands.</p>

<p>That being said, the food is surprisingly normal, hearty in a classic Italian American way. To my mainstream white boy sensibility, it's not so much unusual in how it tastes but in the way its prepared and served. For example, the chicken tastes baked and tomatoey. There are great chunks of not overcooked potato and carrot that still have some bite. It reminds me of the crock pot style of my upbringing, but Lettensa says that everything is steamed here, not stewed. And they only use olive oil. I actually can believe that the food here is healthy (like almost no restaurant food is).</p>

<p>The salad comes with feta cheese, lemon, and vinegar, though I wasn't fond of the onion in the salad, which a sharp flavor that contrasts with the mellow. But I loved the spinach, cooked thoroughly into almost a stew, which was perhaps my favorite of the combination. The beef was weirdly familiar, tasting like beef stroganoff.</p>

<p>In all, the experience was unusual and relaxing, while going well beyond "somewhat accessible" that most ethnic restaurants bring. While you can find some surprises -- they make a traditional honey wine with raisin and hops for example -- the keyword for Asmara Restaurant is relaxation.</p>

<p>"We want to make them relax and show them our culture," Lettensa says, whose family encouraged her to start a restaurant because she was so enthused about cooking. They leave a pitcher of water on the table so you don't worry about water. They have a television, but only for showing Eritrean song & dance -- they are not a sports bar.</p>

<p>I felt at home, and you will too. Asmara Restaurant is a unique experience that is familiar at the same time. That being said, there were quite a few fruit flies, and with the food that wasn't exceptional in its taste or price, and lackluster decor, I must give it a solid rather than the highest rating. You should definitely try it at least once and decide for yourself.</p>

<p>Billy Bartley never stops grilling the entire time we speak. The police officer sitting to my left says he's only seen someone who's not Bill on the grill just once in 25 years. Intense with energy, Bill looks a little like Michael Keaton, and it's easy to believe that he's secretly Batman. "This is a full contact restaurant," he says. "I've got a motor.". With his back turned toward me and the noise the restaurant, it's hard to hear him speak. So I ask him to repeat, and after he does, I say, "Oh, I thought you were saying that you've got a boner."</p>

<p>"Now you're getting my sense of humor!" he replies.</p>

<p>Mr. Bartley's is an institution, just like Harvard Square, which is where it's located. There is a lot of activity, even at 4pm, and the decor is homey, with crap on the walls that isn't generic like what you'd find at TGI Friday's. The crap, including a real MBTA subway sign, obviously has a history and a personal connection to the people who work here. The place is only adequately lit and comes with a heavily varnished wood interior, giving it a feel like a pub. It seats 60 but I've seen it bustling & packed late at night with what must be more. They have outdoor seating during warm weather, as well, but no public restroom (is that legal?).</p>

<p>Billy's dad founded the resturant in 1960, the year Billy was born. "I worked here a lot as a kid," he says. "They treated me like veal cow, put me in a corner and put me to work & didn't feed me much." Despite some Irish decor, "There's no Irish theme to the menu, just to me. I've got surliness, interrupt everyone, the great Irish qualities, drink too much..."</p>

<p>"... And loyalty," I suggest. It's clear from the way he banters with his staff and customers that Billy's created an inclusive atmosphere, like the place is his family.</p>

<p>"That's true," he says. "Customers have made my life. I'd kill for my customers."</p>

<p>It seems to be working. With all the activity here, they could clearly raise prices above the college student level, but Billy says they've decided not to. "It's definitely a thought, but we have a great relationship with our customers and we want to keep it."</p>

<p>The menu of course features burgers, but also has salad, appetizers, and soda fountain drinks. The Ezra's smores frappe, for example, is thick enough to eat with a spoon and comes with whipped cream and a cherry. I found it a little too sweet.</p>

<p>I ask for the best items on the menu, and while I'm waiting for a burger, they serve me the baked macaroni & cheese. "It's so good that the people who work there aren't allowed to have it," one of the staff says, or else it would all be gone. It's very thick, too dry for me, and the cheese isn't interesting -- not sharp or overly creamy. And it doesn't come with bread crumbs. This is the meal they're proudest of? I think, eyeing a giant banner skeptically.</p>

<p>It says, "Voted one of the best burgers in the USA by Wall Street Journal".</p>

<p>Then the plate comes. All the burgers here have names, and mine is the Jersey Shore, with bacon, cheese, mushrooms. There's no way to pick up the burger, though, because the plate's piled so high with toppings and sweet potato fries.</p>

<p>The fries, Billy tells me, are soaked in water overnight to take the starch out, blanched, then fried. They are surprisingly free of grease. Who ever heard of fries without grease? They taste wholesome and thick. The onions are incredibly juicy, not dead like the onions you find on most pub burgers.</p>

<p>Finally I dig down to the burger. Hot damn! This really might be the best burger in America. The 7oz burger comes with a pepper based topping and it's one of the few New England burgers that it would be a sin to put catsup on.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should stick to the burger part of the menu, but with low prices and a zany atmosphere, it's a place I have no reservations rating a must-see the next time you're near Harvard. Although I could not give it as high a rating as a restaurant (<a href="/restaurants_in_boston/about-our-ratings.html">about our ratings</a>), it easily earns 4.5 stars in the cafe / pub category.</p>

<p>The first things you notice about Casablanca are the murals of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman: and yes, it's about the movie, the 1942 classic.</p>

<p>Sari Abul-Jubain, the owner, is a dynamic man who is clearly proud of the place. He gives me the full tour and it becomes the longest conversation I've had with a restaurant owner. He grew up in Syria and came to Boston in 1971 as waiter and bartender at Casablanca, which was founded in 1955 in the basement of the Brattle Theatre by the same owner as just a bar.</p>

<p>Sari took on a money partner and bought the place in 1976. The murals by David Omar went up starting in the 1980s. Casablanca is dark and upscale, and with the murals its a great setting for romance. And yet, the intimate atmosphere is not standoffishly upscale. It's comfortable. Sari says that he did not want an upscale restaurant, but a damn good one that could be attractive to people from all walks of life.</p>

<p>I'm more than a little surprised to find that this is not a Moroccan-themed restaurant using the movie as marketing. The movie is the theme, making the restaurant a bit of a Disneyland, a work of the imagination. The main chefs are Italian and Columbian. Sari called it first a Continental restaurant, and then Mediterranean: in other words, anything. They don't try too heavily for a Mediterranean feel, and change the menu to suit the season. Although Sari assures me that the focus is on the food, I suggest perhaps the focus is on the atmosphere, and he says that too.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is fun. As well as ample seating, there's an open bar area, and Sari takes on the role of "the mayor", socializing and introducing people. It's a cocktail party atmosphere with chair bar stools that aren't fixed so you can move them into groups. Still, I don't sense a master plan, or perhaps I just don't "get it". This place would be perfect for live music, perhaps a piano, which would fit the Casablanca theme. But they don't host live music, and the jukebox isn't used much.</p>

<p>Sari gives me a tour of the kitchen, which features a smoker oven. Barbecue is not grilling, he tells me. Barbecue is cooking slowly under indirect heat with wood or charcoal, for 10-12 hours. His vision is to build out the barbecue portion of their menu, and become known for takeout as well.</p>

<p>The menu, which has a substantial wine list, runs the gamut from cheap to expensive, and I sample quite a few items. The Sari's lamb cooked barbecue style, has a "pulled" consistency that's extremely tender, and juicy without being greasy. The best was the flat bread pizza. They make our own dough and add caramelized onion and unusual toppings you won't find in a pizza shop. It's flavorful and has a minimum of cheese on the flat bread, letting the tastes come through.</p>

<p>They also serve chickpea fries, which are not sticks but wedges. They have a crisp exterior but a soft interior, like mashed potatoes, and served with a cream dip. It's distinctive. Most of the dishes seem to follow this formula of a bland central piece with a zesty side or dip: the Turkish meze plate, the deviled eggs, and the lamb ribs, for example.</p>

<p>I spoke with the chef who confirmed that I'm not imagining things. Yes, there's nothing spicy on their menu and it could be called bland. There were interesting elements, but nothing mind-blowing. To me it feels like a restaurant built by experience and patchwork rather than being the deliberate end product of a master restauranteur with a compelling vision. I recommend it to you as a bar with great space and a full menu. But as a restaurant, it resembles its origins, put together as though on a whim by a guy who liked a movie.</p>

<p>This the restaurant I dream of at night. Although it's Brazilian, they buy their meat from the midwest United States and they call it the Midwest Grill. It was opened in 1993 by owner Gilnei Pinto, whose family also owns Cafe Brazil in Allston. But I spoke with Eustaquio Langame, the manager, who didn't want his photo taken.</p>

<p>"I have done everything here," he says. He came to Boston from Brazil at 16 as a dishwasher, and then became a meat cutter, busboy, waiter, cook, bartender, and finally manager of the restaurant.</p>

<p>The place is huge, with the romance of the North End without the packed tables. There's ample seating for 125 people and the atmosphere is festive and hearty, with earth tones. There's a full bar but it's at the back of the restaurant but it does not dominate the space. The atmosphere is "old country" homey, not overly ritzy, but comfortable, with a lot of brick and varnished wood. Easy listening brazilian music plays over the speakers, and they have live bossa nova, samba, and jazz, five nights a week.</p>

<p>Although they have a small menu, you come for the buffet and the "rodizio", which means, you sit and they bring unlimited meat to your table. You don't even have to get up. Just enjoy yourself and waiters come by with huge chunks of meat fresh from a rotary broiler. When your rodizio card is green side up, they come. When you're full, turn it over to the red ride, and they stop. You open the menu and read "chicken wrapped bacon", but I'm pretty sure that should be "bacon wrapped chicken".</p>

<p>Don't load up on the buffet. It's a good value, but ordinary, even if you come when it's fresh at 5pm, unlike my arrival time of 3:30pm. The french fries were greasy, cold, and hardened. The beans, vegetables, and dirty rice were hearty but nothing special, although I liked the meatballs and sauce with cooked peppers that melt in your mouth. And the whole carrots and broccoli were wholesome and still had some crunch to them. Unfortunately, the salad bar did not come with toppings like mushrooms or croutons, although it does come with pineapple in condensed milk, surely a bad combination or maybe a joke on us gringos. Also, I saw a fly. One fly is no big deal, but the buffet stands open for hours.</p>

<p>All of this doesn't matter, because the meat is perfect. They must have killed an angel to make the lamb.</p>

<p>They must have killed a lamb angel, I mean. A lamb that died, went to heaven, became an angel, and was killed and carved up. Look, just go with the metaphor.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's a great mouth feel with a chew that has no strings or fat. All the meats here are hearty, and Eustaquio tells me they marinate it in red wine, with salt, pepper, and vinegar. Meats are often tasty, but come with a fatty or regretful sensation. This meat is nourishing.</p>

<p>The beef sirloin is served without any additive except sea salt. I try some and think, Holey moley, I thought the <em>lamb</em> was good!! It's juicy and it would be spoiled rather than helped by steak sauce.</p>

<p>It's so good that I can't stop eating, even after I'm full. The pork loin is merely excellent. The sausage is strikingly hot & spicy, almost too salty, but consistent, with no gristly particles. The texture of all the meats is flawless.</p>

<p>Best of all, the lunch buffet is just $13 for all you can eat, and take out is cheap at $6-7 a pound.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I didn't care for the garlic bread, which was fresh and hot, but came without garlic or butter that I could taste. So it's basically a sourdough roll. The rice pudding is cinnamon over a basic rice substrate, a little too sweet, and comes with butterscott drizzle and whipped cream, which I found I didn't need.</p>

<p>My pick was the strawberry cheesecake, which I spent some time just admiring while trying to digest all the meat. It sits on a  thin bread substrate rather than on crumbs. After eating the cheesecake, its chocolate drizzle, and the whipped cream, I almost picked up the plate and licked it clean. It's not too rich or sweet, but enough calories that it's better split with a friend.</p>

<p>In summary, Midwest Grill transform you. With attentive waitstaff serving you rodizio, you could enter a starving immigrant, a waif fresh off the boat and leave fireproof and stout. I've been to fancy steakhouses, and this is just as good and so much less expensive. And if you're too lazy to leave home, they offer delivery.</p>

<p>I might be ordering out a lot from now on.</p>

<p>Thanks to paparazzi, Hollywood still has glamour but not the mystery of the 1920s, 1930s, or 1940s. That's the theme behind Cuchi Cuchi, a restaurant with full bar where you not so much step back in time but step into another dimension: a sexualized, artistic landscape. It's garish to an extreme, and even the servers wear costumes. You may, for example, see a waitress with a bowl of fruit on her head, and against one wall is a mannequin wearing the dance costume Catherine Zeta Jones wore in the movie Chicago. And she's holding a fetish whip.</p>

<p>But it works. Below ceiling fans, the walls are hung with throwbacks whose colors and themes match. The tone is mellow, with 1930s music playing that even includes the original low-tech hiss. It's dark, but not too dark to communicate or bring family, and at 6pm it's nowhere near too noisy to speak. That's important to me, a guy who likes to chat with my friends, dates, and family over dinner instead of just stare at them. It has 58 sit-down table seats, and 25 bar seats.</p>

<p>I spoke with Nereida Restrepo, the manager, who came from Colombia without speaking English at all to work at the nearby Green Street Grill, a place I used to frequent before they started serving macaroni and cheese. "I got into the restaurant business because I love people", she told me, "and didn't want to sit in an office. I made the switch to Cuchi Cuchi because it had everything I was looking for and more. It's classy and so much fun."</p>

<p>The place is garish to an extreme, but despite the costumes, it's for adults. You could have a great bachelorette party here. That really hits home when you see their menu, with 4 pages of cocktails, wine, and beer. Nereida tells me that unlike many restaurants, where the owners never visit, at Cuchi Cuchi the owners are engaged and have a real vision that covers both the cuisine and the decor. They aren't just trying to save money on food and staff. Before you eat, they serve you a hot towel which comes prepackaged and I hope is more than just water, which doesn't sanitize.</p>

<p>The menu has an innovative concept: you make more money selling half-size plates. Although they don't call it Spanish tapas, because the food comes from around the world, the concept is the same. You order 2 or 3 items per person and share with the people you're with. The appetizer style dishes arrive appetizer swiftly, too. "The food is meant to be shared", Nereida says, "with intense flavors." They have a gluten-free menu, too, for those of you with wheat allergies.</p>

<p>Everything I had was delicious. The sizzling garlic shrimp ($10) was meaty and rich, without that limp, overcooked texture you sometimes find, in an interesting oil base. The fried artichoke hearts ($14) came breaded with a creamy interior of cheese and chopped pistachios. It had a paste texture but was juicy. The grilled skirt steak, Argentinan style, ($15) was invigorating, with a garlic sauce that makes you not want to share it with anyone.</p>

<p>The only misstep perhaps was the "Cuban Cigar", shredded beef in a flaky dough package served piping hot, which came with beans in an alcohol mix that went way beyond the slight taste you get in a wine sauce. What is it with this place and alcohol? I thought. I don't drink myself, but don't normally have any trouble adapting.</p>

<p>Really, there was nothing ordinary on the menu, which reminded me of Not Your Average Joe's. Every dish is severed with a different twist. For example, the chicken kiev ($14) was drier than I was expecting, with breading around hearty good chicken, a vegetable medley, and perhaps too much butter, but really good. The cheesecake was very citrusy, with what tasted like mango rind, not too rich, and tart as well as sweet -- a great improvement over the Cheesecake Factory style which stomps on your heart with sugar and richness. And it came with an edible chocolate butterfly. The presentation on all the dishes was impressive.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a not too positive review of Casablanca and felt slightly guilty for accusing them of not having an compelling and unifying restaurant vision. Now I know I was right. Although it's expensive, Cuchi Cuchi is a great place to hang out with friends, family, or on a date, and while I was there I saw people of all ages and types, not just 20-somethings. Although I cannot put Cuchi Cuchi in my "Dining Experience" tier, the top tier of reviews, I will gladly give them 4.5 out of 4.5 stars in the "Restaurant" tier.</p>

<p>Spice & Rice is a work of art. This is not your Chinatown hole in the wall. It's modern and brightly colored, with shapes that avoid the rectagonal. "If we'd had the space we would have built a traditional Thai tea house in here," the manager, Mookda "Sammi" Suppanisanuwong, told me. It is filled with the sound of easy listening music, and seats almost 50 people, including a bar area that is separate from the restaurant. The decoration of the room is impressive, and the highlight is a fish tank that's built into one of the walls.</p>

<p>Although it is a Thai restaurant, Spice & Rice includes sushi and Korean food, too, and they have a greater variety than most of their competitors. Sammi tells me that the owner of Spice & Rice, Penjan Janburiwong, grew up selling pad thai on the streets of Thailand with her mother and grandmother, who were sidewalk vendors. Now that is a competitive market for Thai food! Then Penjan got married and moved to Boston around 1990. Now Spice & Rice has become a popular spot known for its accessible food.</p>

<p>It certainly seems accesible to me. I'm a white bread boy used to more asian cusines that are tilted slightly for American appetites. Spice & Rice used to draw me in all the time with its comforting food when I lived in Inman Square, which regrettably is not close to the subway and rarely has adequate parking. Now Sammi and Penjan are trying to build the business in two ways: by expanding their catering business -- what could be more unique than having Thai food at your wedding, with a chef who stands right there preparing sushi for your guests? -- and by expanding their menu to include new dishes that are more authentic, to draw in ethnic Thais and those who want a more daring ethnic experience.</p>

<p>Sammi got me a number of dishes from the new menu. The salmon taktarki is an appetizer, a hearty salad with sushi, cucumber, and carrot. It's spicy and will clear out your sinuses. The sushi is smooth and melts in the mouth almost without chewing. I prefered it to the mango maki, straight up sushi with raspberries, which was solid but bland. Of course, you can spice your sushi to taste with wasabe, ginger, and soy sauce.</p>

<p>What struck me more than the food itself was its presentation. Look at the photographs! As well as having a modern, arty, interesting atmosphere, Spice & Rice has a unique, eye-catching look to each dish. For example, the "crispy duck" had broccoli dyed in different colors. I avoid deli meat that's sliced so thinly that you can barely tell what it is. The crispy duck at Spice & Rice is the opposite. Flavorful and with a bit of crunch, the chunks of thick juicy bird reminded me of a thanksgiving dinner. The only reservation I might have is that, with the duck skin left on, the dish is a little tough.</p>

<p>I also tried the tomyum fried rice, which I just had to admire for a minute before digging in. Look at the photograph! It's an egg fried rice, with lime, shrimp, scallops, and pepper. It's interesting and spicy, but very pungent and perhaps too heavy. Despite its small size, this is definitely a meal.</p>

<p>And Sammi brought out some sticky rice with mango. It's a desert. Yum! It has a wonderful coconut smell, and it's not really "like" anything in my experience... rice pudding I suppose... it's chewiness is in-between custard and taffy. It's not too sweet. It's a great balance between being a unique food you won't find elsewhere and an accessible food that it's safe to try if you're not very daring.</p>

<p>Finally, I had the pad thai from the new menu, the spicy version. Wow! Pad thai is normally so greasy that it tastes great going down, but then you regret it later. Lovers of oily Indian food will know what I am talking about. But this new pad thai, with shrimp and a wedge of lime, was somehow not slimy. Instead I found it wholesome, transformative. It energizes instead of saps you. The oil that covers it tastes more like a sauce.</p>

<p>All told, I found the food Spice & Rice slightly on the bland side, but with some exceptional stand out meals. Although I cannot give it the very highest rating, in its price range it is unsurpassed in its presentation and atmosphere. It's very much the impressive restaurant you can actually afford to bring a date or your family to.</p>

<p>India Castle does not impress on the first glance. It seats nearly 50 people, and the walls, which are brick and rectangular with traditional Indian paintings, clash with the ceiling, which is brightly colored and curved in modern swoops. It makes me wonder if the restaurant has grown organically rather than being the product of a unified grand vision. There's a full bar with a television, but it doesn't dominate the space. This is definitely more a restaurant than a bar.</p>

<p>I was able to interview the manager, Mantosh Upadhayaya. Although he's from Nepal, he loves India's similar food and culture. I've never had a restaurant manager say anything but that their food is better than anyone else's, so when Mantosh says it too, I remained skeptical. Still, he insisted that more ethnic Indians choose India Castle over competitive restaurants, and it could be true.</p>

<p>A couple of nearby diners, Claire Winthrop and Tatiana Brainerd, chipped in too. "We love this place," Claire said. "My Indian friends had their child's birthday party here, and this is the place I recommend to all my friends. Even my 5-year-old daughter, who can be finnicky, loves the food here."</p>

<p>Why does she love the food so much? "They focus on getting the best ingredients."</p>

<p>Mantosh elaborated. "Our food is not oily or fatty, it's just like it's homemade," he said. "Other restaurants use tomato paste, but we grind fresh tomatoes and make our own sauce. We're the only ones in the Boston area who do it." I suppose that could be true, too, but it's hard to believe that no other Indian restaurant in Greater Boston can be bothered to grind tomatoes.</p>

<p>One thing I can validate though is the presence of India Castle's wonderful bread. Most Indian buffets leave a pile of naan in a buffet basket, but India Castle brings out fresh naan to everyone. It's fresh, warm, and soft, and not greasy. Delightful! And for dinner they set little burners at each table to keep the main entrees warm, Mantosh told me.</p>

<p>So, I tried the buffet, which came marked with the names of all the foods. It even comes with a salad option and special dessert balls called gulab jamun. The most disitinctive meal in the buffet was goat curry, which they serve Mondays and Fridays. I'm afraid I didn't care for it. It had bones and the meat was tough.</p>

<p>Mantosh got me a mango lassi, a mixed drink like a smoothie that comes with ice cubes. It was frothy and pure. I commented that I wished that the ice cubes could be mixed in, and Mantosh brought me a vanilla milkshake to follow. That hit the spot! The shake comes not fully blended, so it still has ice crystals, which have a nice crunch to them, and the vanilla flavoring is strong. It was not too thick, and had a rich milk taste. Boy! That would be just what I'd need on a hot day.</p>

<p>From the buffet, the chicken tikka masala was my favorite: tender, spicy, and delicious. But every Indian restaurants offers a similar meal. I asked Mantosh if India Castle had a dish that was completely unique and he replied that although every meal they serve you can find elsewhere, they do it better.</p>

<p>Running a restaurant is tough and I love to support local businesses, but it doesn't help anyone for me to go soft as a reviewer. It's possible that India Castle is fantastic and I either missed it or I'm just not acquainted enough with real Indian food to tell. Unfortunately, I don't think so. I found India Castle a little spicier than competitive places, and overall solid, but average in the presentation, atmosphere, and quality of the food. By all means go if you are in the area! It's inexpensive and perhaps you'll become one of their many regulars by sensing something that I missed. But even Claire and Tatiana, who are fans, admitted that they chose India Castle partly because it's convenient to where they work.</p>

<p>It was good that I arrived early at East Coast Grill for a review of brunch -- not dinner -- and was able to speak with manager Robin Greenspan before they opened, because at 11am, the place goes from zero to full in 10 minutes. "We want a restaurant that has the absolute best food," Robin told me, "but in a relaxed environment that doesn't take itself so seriously. It's informal and you can dresss down. I love it here. I'm going to [work here the rest of my life and] die here."</p>

<p>East Coast Grill does seem to have arrived. The owner, Chris Schlesinger, has become a restaurant phenomenon who has written 8 cookbooks, which are displayed around the restaurant. That's impressive and lends credence to the idea that the East Coast Grill is a nationwide landmark, not a local dive. Chris is always traveling and bringing back ideas, Robin told me. The theme of East Coast Grill? They serve seafood and barbecue, with tastes from all over North and South America, including the Caribbean. Nobody else does live fire grilling, Robin said, or has such exceptionally fresh seafood.</p>

<p>The only other big seafood place in Cambridge is Legal Sea Foods, which like any chain, so Robin told me, has to play it safe. The most respected seafood places in Boston can be pretentious, lacking a grounded personality. I see that. Personally, I only go to Legal Sea Foods when my parents come to town or I want to take out an important client. If you go on a date or with friends, it can impress, but also backfire, with its stilted atmosphere preventing you from being yourselves. Once at Legal Sea Foods, when I was dying of thirst, I asked a waiter to bring me two glasses of water or a full pitcher. He refused, seeming insulted by my implication that he might not refill my one water glass quickly enough. Right or wrong, that made it hard for me to feel at ease.</p>

<p>East Coast Grill flips that idea on its head. It's comfortable, making it a great hangout and date location, yet still a place you can bring family to. It seats more than 100, including seating at the bar, but the bar doesn't dominate: it's very much a restaurant, not a gallery of sports televisions. It's upscale and modern, with blue and green sea colors, heavily varnished tables, and a self-service bloody mary bar to the left of the main bar itself. The music is joyful and upbeat, and it's too dimly lit for a morning meal, but there's direct sunlight peeking through the shades, which helps. Thankfully, the tables aren't packed impossibly close (like at Red Bones in Somerville). The customers make a pleasant buzz but it's not too loud to have a conversation. It's visually magnificent to watch the chefs work in the open kitchen, but distracting that they shout to each other.</p>

<p>Arthur Muller, the brunch captain, offered me some fresh squeezed orange juice that has big chunks of pulp: just how I like it! It's like God's own juice (but at $5.50 for a large glass, it should be). And he told me about the menu. When I think of brunch, I imagine good old American comfort food: pancakes, french toast, eggs and sausage. Eating all those carbs might put you back to bed again on a sleepy Sunday morning. East Coast Grill surprised me. They offer a latin american brunch, with few "ordinary" dishes. The menu prices range from inexpensive to upscale.</p>

<p>The first meal I tried was the smoked pork stuffed banana, which I'm sure is delicious, and I get it -- the coolness of the banana offsets the hot spices. Unfortunately it was way too spicy. The first bite I took of the mustard sauce made me gasp, still with food in my mouth, so much that I got the hiccups. And had to blow my nose. Wow! That will really clear out your pipes!</p>

<p>So, points for an original dish concept. But it is sad to be a restaurant reviewer who can only taste burning. It took a few minutes with milk and corn bread to get back onto the job. I couldn't taste the corn bread, but it was served warm and smelled good. It didn't seem sweetened, like a cake, which I'm told is the way it's supposed to be. (I like it Jiffy Mix sweet, but hey, I'm not from the South, so I don't get to decide these things.)</p>

<p>My favorite brunch dish at the East Coast Grill was the cheese and duck stuffed tortillas. It was perfect in every way, with a jack cheese that was interesting and not generic, a salsa that didn't take over, and the duck and flaky tortilla shell mixed into truly one grand flavor. And you have to try the key lime pie, which I can only describe as A Powerful Force For Good in the Universe. It is too rich and sweet for one person, though -- make sure to split it with someone.</p>

<p>Less to my liking were the fried fish tacos, which are served with slaw and beans. I loved the sweet glaze, and the chunks of fish were hearty... it had a mouth feel like real meat, not "bite size" niblets. And I found the smell of the beans and moist rice a reminder of home. However, in my opinion the sweet sauce didn't mix well with the bitter vinegar taste from the slaw, which was mixed in rather than served on the side.</p>

<p>So there were meals at East Coast Grill that I liked and meals that I didn't. But unlike my review this week of India Castle, where I just didn't find the food superior, I am starting to "get" the East Coast Grill. Here is their secret: even though I'm a white bread European-American and I think I know everything about brunch, I am wrong. The East Coast Grill is challenging me out of my comfort zone. And there's nothing wrong with that. All the food there is excellent -- but like any ethnic restaurant, some of it will be for you and some of it will be too exotic. Imagine that: a brunch that's exotic!</p>

<p>Of course, I'm not necessarily seeking an exotic brunch on a Sunday morning, if I was up late the previous night. I might choose then to go to Zaftig in Brookline or Johnny D's in Somerville. I tried the french toast at the East Coast Grill: it was solid but average.</p>

<p>But I highly recommend the East Coast Grill for a brunch that's a unique experience, something that wakes you and shakes you, for those mornings that you don't have a hangover and find yourself with the energy for an adventure. Whether you call it a latin brunch (I think it's more of a lunch, personally) makes no difference. It's clearly popular with the locals, and you may find yourself lining up in the cold before the restaurant opens, like the 20 people I counted on my way in!</p>

<p>I may try to return to do a straight dinner review. East Coast Grill is the only alternative sea food place in Cambridge that I can think of besides Legal Sea Foods and Blue Dolphin. That by itself makes it worth a visit.</p>

<p>The Sunday that I visited the White Horse Tavern, it was mobbed with students. There was a long line of Boston University students there for a special brunch, and apparently I only caught the tail end of the madness. It was loud, and except for the staff, I was the oldest guy in the place by 20 years. While waiting for the manager, I looked around.</p>

<p>The place is huge, with seating for more than 100 people, including at the bar, but it holds 400 if they are standing and mixing around the pool tables. There are actually two bars: one that dominates one end of the restaurant and one that dominates the other end, with a projection TV showing sports, and sports televisions hanging all over. You'll even find a couple of video games hidden away. The heavily varnished tables, plus the neon beer signs, made me think very much of a pub that I'd normally avoid because I don't drink alcohol. I prefer to talk with whomever I'm with over dinner rather than be distracted by televisions.</p>

<p>Is there anything at White Horse Tavern for a guy like me who's not here to drink?</p>

<p>That's just what we're working on, I was told by William Johnson, the operator of the business. He'd recently returned from Chicago opening high-end bars, was previously the manager at Game On near Fenway Park, and was the youngest manager ever at Boston's Bennigans. Will was hired by the owner of the White Horse Tavern, Doug Bacon, to keep the fun going for college students -- especially Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, with trivia nights -- but to add a new experience. They want "put the 'T' back in Tavern", Will says. They want to return to the traditional New England tavern to Boston.</p>

<p>What's a traditional Old Boston tavern? It's where you can get a hearty meal as well as drink, and where the atmosphere allows for socializing across the room, not just with your friends at one table. It's really too loud for conversation most nights after 11pm, but I'm told that early evenings or any time Mondays and Tuesdays are more relaxed times.</p>

<p>So they are changing their look -- the neon beer signs are to come down, apparently -- and expanding their menu as well. This is all a work in progress. Will came in last October and hired a new executive chef just in December. The changes that they are implenting are extensive. The bar food is completely gone, Will tells me. All their sauces are now made in house, everything is fresh and nothing comes frozen except the french fries, and they're working on that, too. Fridays & Saturdays the kitchen stays open to 1am, and they are working now on craft beers. (As a guy who does not drink, I do not let on that I do not know what craft beers are. Really smart beers, I guess. Crafty.) They often DJs spinning music and plan to use their license for live music as well.</p>

<p>Really? I asked, politely suggesting that Will is exaggerating. This is a pub. So your chicken nuggets don't come in frozen bags that you heat in a microwave? It's fresh?</p>

<p>Will and I go through the menu and select a few dishes that are unique and a few mainstream comfort foods. The brunch menu doesn't have many traditional brunch foods, like eggs and pancakes, although they do offer french toast. It's mainly nodified dinner foods, like breakfast hamburgers, breakfast pizza, and breakfast burritos. For dinners, they serve a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, salads, soups, but only five entrees.</p>

<p>It's absolutely fresh, he said. Okay, I reply skeptically. I took a look around at the B.U. students, all of whom are too young to remember a time before the Internet. Many of them look permanently hung over and some of them seem wired Cyborg-style to their handheld devices. As a pre-emptive measure, I politely mention that my refrigerator is full from the leftovers from recent reviews and I mean no disrepect if I'm unable to take home the food that remains after my sampling today. (What have I gotten myself into?)</p>

<p>I regret my skepticism with the very first meal. Their French toast is perfect. It comes folded over with a filling inside like a cinammon roll, served with strawberries and just enough syrup already on the plate. Let me say that again: PERFECT. Holy crap, I thought. Maybe they weren't exaggerating when they said that they wanted to serve really good food here.</p>

<p>I said as much to the executive chef, Matthew Bailey, who came out to chat and didn't seem put off by my assumption that a bar would of course offer bar food, not food food, never mind PERFECT food.</p>

<p>"We want the White Horse Tavern to still be a great college bar and hangout, but we're determined to create a sensation with our menu, to have a traditional tavern feel," he told me.</p>

<p>What kind of cuisine is that? It's not Irish specifically, but draws from Ireland, the UK, Canada, America, and even Central America. "If it's not fresh we're not serving it," he said. And they don't want an overly corporate feeling. This is not TGIF, where they decorate by putting crap on the walls with no heart or soul.</p>

<p>Instead of serving buffalo wings, they slow cook "buffalo lollipops" before their quick dip in the fryolater. You can hold the bone ending without getting your fingers dirty and the meat is chunky, interesting. Just don't take an up close sniff like I did. Wow! That is some sharp buffalo sauce, but that's sharp, not oily/disguisting like most buffalo wings. Yum.</p>

<p>They're not there yet, but they are nearly five months into a transition and there are definite signs of progress. Ron Abbott, another manager, speaks with me as well. "We've taken this transformation on as a big project, to recharge our batteries and fall back in love with the business", he says. "We want our bartenders to know the names of the regular customers, not just take the orders. People should feel like they're with friends when they're here." Right, I think, like Cheers, but for real, not a tourist trap. You want to go where everybody knows your name.</p>

<p>My favorite meal was the braised pork hash. This is the meal to order when you go. It's perfectly smooth and chewable pork meat with a texture that reminds me of sushi, and just a hint of grease. Watch out for the uncooked yolk though. I've always shied away from 'breakfast pizza' because eggs are heavy, and pizza crust is heavy. It's not usually a good combination, but somehow it works at White Horse Tavern. Even 20 minutes after being served -- which is how long it took to chat with the staff -- the pizza crust did not go hard to heavy. It was still soft, and not overcooked, with the toppings decently juicy. I'm sorry to say that the hamburger bun (from the Tavern Burger Breakfast Style) did go hard in that time, and I only nibbled at the egg and burger combo. See, egg is a meat. Hamburger is a meat. Maybe it's just me. I think hamburger toppings should be non-meats. Yet, I have to recommend the hash browns, served in a patty, like a pancake, rather than how they come at most other restaurants: in a heap running with oil. It was delicious! Their slaw doesn't have that bitter vinegar taste to it, or an overly mushy mayonnaise taste -- both good things.</p>

<p>Although they are clearly still in a transition, I sense success in their goal to infuse an already popular bar with new energy and a new customer base that's perhaps a little older, perhaps not, but definitely including people like me who aren't looking for a buzz, just a comfortable spot to hang out with friends. As a restaurant, the White Horse Tavern's menu is too new and rough for my highest rating, and the atmosphere is still very much on the bar side of the scale. But in the cafe/pub category  (<a href="http://bostoneventsinsider.com/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html" target=_blank>learn more about our ratings</a>), I am happy to give them an outstanding 3.5. You will find great food there!</p>

<p>On my way out, I make sure to have everything that's left packaged to go. My fridge is indeed full. But I will find room.</p>

<p>I almost didn't write this review, because I didn't want to seem self-indulgent. A rule of journalism is that you are not the news. Yet, I have a pretty good track record of hunting restaurants down. Of the 31 that I've approached (excluding those who've made no reply at all), 29 have said yes to a review. One said no politely. The other was Miracle of Science, and when I called in the manager on duty was not polite. I don't think it's self-indulgent for me to say that if a manager in a service industry who knows he's talking with a journalist can go from zero to "fuck you" in 90 seconds, something is wrong.</p> 

<p>So from memory, here's what I remember about Miracle of Science. It's like Justin Bieber. Your friends love him way too much, which makes it annoying to be the one hold-out who thinks he's over-hyped. I've heard a lot of people say that they like the place. I think I get it. It's small but fahsionable. The atmosphere is intelligent and trendy, clean and professional.</p>

<p>That's as a bar, though. I don't drink, so I go to places as restaurants or cafes. I've been to Miracle of Science for food three times -- though not since 2003 -- twice for brunch and once for dinner. The meals were expensive, small in size, and not very appetizing. I came away thinking that the place is over-hyped.</p>

<p>But you never know. I called in hoping to return and find out. But I guess I won't be going back. As a bar, I'm sure it has some chops. As a restaurant -- and it does have "grill" in its name -- in my opinion, don't go.</p>

<p>Blue Ribbon BBQ could do with a paint job and scrubbing. "We actually plan to do some painting soon, maybe next week," Jill Garza, the manager, tells me, which is either true or brilliant thing to improvise when I point out the dirty bench, stains on the walls, and flaking paint on the chairs. Country and easy listening music plays on overhead speakers.</p>

<p>Seating only 12 people, with bar stools for 6, the location in Arlington (they also have one in West Newton) is wonderfully kitsch. The brick look is painted on and clashes with an inadequate single coat of yellow paint through which you can see still the previous coat of blue. If this is an artistic pretention to being a 1950s shack in the South, it is flawless. Or have they just let the place go?</p>

<p>Of course, Blue Ribbon BBQ is more of a takeout place, so maybe the decor doesn't matter. Jill is from the midwest, like the restaurant's owners, who then grew up in Boston and one of whom went to college in Virginia and fell in love with the cuisine. They make all their sauces and cornbread batter from scratch, and smoke their meats 12-14 hours, so the fat melts off, giving the meat a lot of flavor. Their business is so popular that they outgrew their own kitchen and have meats delivered every morning from a central commissary.</p>

<p>What sets Blue Ribbon BBQ apart? Jill says that instead of providing a sit down environment, their focus is on really good food served quickly, they have a broader menu than competitors, and they don't fry anything, which keeps the food healthier. "We serve up the genuine traditional cuisine of the underprivileged South," she tells me. But we Northern geeks can order the food with an mobile iPhone application, a nice treat.</p>

<p>My initial skepticism about Blue Ribbon BBQ's decor was overthrown instantly when I ate. The corn chowder is spicy, definitely a soup not a stew, but not milky. The collard greens are like a spinach, served in a warm broth that's almost a soup, that melts in your mouth. Jill says it's okay to add hot sauce to either. I like that. It's like the food is a masterpiece, but it's not sacred. You may season to taste.</p>

<p>The pulled pork is great on its own, with a chewy but soft mouth feel that's very pure. It so good that you want to slow down to savor each bite. The brisket is a little dry, but hearty and totally devoid of gristle, like a chunk of Thanksgiving turkey you can really sink your teeth into, although it's beef of course. The ribs are not fatty but you will definitely want to add sauce on it, because they are plain on their own. Blue Ribbon BBQ also makes their own sweet tea and lemonade, which are invigorating.</p>

<p>The beans are not mexican burrito styled, but have more of a baked beans taste. And the slaw -- well, I've always hated cole slaw since grade school, that combination of overly creamy mush with overly sharp vinegar and a few slimy veggies inside. Somehow the slaw at Blue Ribbon BBQ avoids either texture. It's basically a potato salad taste without the potato. It's the only slaw I've ever tried that I've liked. Wow.</p>

<p>The regular & hot BBQ sauces are delicious but not destructively hot. Unlike sauces elsewhere that are blended into a pure but overly processed king of ketchup, the sauces at Blue Ribbon BBQ have individual bits of pepper & spice that you can taste, giving them an interesting texture. Even the triple X sauce didn't blow out my taste buds, for which I was thankful. There's no need in my opinion for food to be served ultra-hot, like in college where my friends and I would compete idiotically to eat the absolute hottest food while pretending it was nothing. The mustard sauce reminds me of the glaze on a holiday ham, sweet and full, probably containing brown sugar.</p>

<p>I didn't care for the jabanero vinegar dipping sauce, which was hot without being interesting in its composure - so hot in fact that I got the hiccups when I took a sip directly from the tiny plastic sauce cup and gasped for air. In hindsight, that was probably a bad idea. That left me unable to taste anything but burning, but fortunately I had already sampled everything else.</p>

<p>Going to Blue Ribbon is like visiting your grandmother's kitchen and having her dote on you. It's uplifting, eye-opening, and you may even see God. It's not just that the meats are good. Every meal seems pure, archetypal, as though they've distilled each dish into the ultimate example of what that dish should be. Then it's your job to take this palette of primal colors and mix them into a masterpiece of your own creation. Now that's good eatin'.</p>

<p>Since it is small and offers no table service, I can't put Blue Ribbon BBQ into the "restaurant" category, but in the "pub / cafe" category <a href="/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html">(about our ratings)</a> I am glad to give it high marks. You will not find food like this anywhere else, and although you can get a better sit down experience at Red Bones, there is generally a wait there and then you are packed in tight with other customers. Takeout is a great alternative, and my own bag "to go" was still warm an hour later. Since I forgot to ask for the pecan pie, I'll have to return soon and hope to upgrade the place to a perfect five stars. It's where Blue Ribbon BBQ really deserves to be.</p>

<p>To some people, it's beautifully kitsch. The Rosebud Diner is an original Worcester dining car, built to fit onto a train, but instead bought and opened in Somerville in 1941. Although it's undeniably homey, it's also homely. Your first impression walking in is the stickers on the door: "booths reserved for parties of two", "please turn off your cell phone", "no outside food allowed", "no smoking", "we check liquor IDs", and "warning, camera on premesis". These aren't bad rules to have, but to post them all on the door is too hick and tasteless for me. I prefer the fantasy that a cute diner in the middle of the nowhere, out in the midwest, is all homemade pie and honey.</p>

<p>You'll get that too at the Rosebud Diner. The manager, Helen DeFrancisco, calls customers "sweetie" and "darling", and when a new customer walks in, seeing the place empty, and thoughtlessly saying, "Oh wow, I guess we won't have to wait long to service," she replies brightly, "No, that's good! Now you've got the whole place to party with." When I accidentally write down her name wrong and imply that she's married to the owner, Bill Nichols, Helen jokes, "What, you think I've got a death wish?"</p>

<p>This is completely charming! But then we're back to Hicksville, when Helen holds up the newspaper and announces to the room, "Who wants to know what their horoscope is today?" Then a few seconds later she tells her coworker that if you have an ear ache, an old home remedy is to put some hot oil on a cotton ball and stick it into your ear. (You should never put anything into your ear.)</p>

<p>Before I can process this, we switch back to completely charming, as Bill, the owner, plays up the kitsch element, bringing out photographs, newspaper articles, and menus from as far back as 70 years ago. Bill's father and Helen's mother both worked here, and now Helen's daughter is on board as well, making the place multigenerational. It's on the national register of historic places. Bill's father bought the dining car in 1958 from the original owners. There are only a few other diners in New England, and only one comes readily to my mind, a place in Waltham on Main Street.</p>

<p>Thus, I'm conflicted. I want so much to like this place, with the waitstaff who clearly befriend all their patrons, the original 1941 counter and tile with a row of barstools and the Valentine's Day decorations that are still up a couple of weeks later. They play 105.7 WROR, the oldies radio station, which is legal since it's a small place (though they can seat 50 people somehow). But there's also a tasteless black and white photo of The Three Stooges on the bar. This place definitely has character, but is it good character? Is this place kitsch or just a dump?</p>

<p>I decide that the food will be the tie-breaker. I've yet to find the way to politely sit and sample a restaurant's food without the owner staring at me. So I sample several dishes while chatting with Helen and Bill. I'm surprised to learn that everything here is baked fresh, and it's all eat-in. They have no delivery or catering business.</p>

<p>The salad is natural, with big delicious chunks of tomato that you could eat with your hands, and grilled chicken. It's primal, simple, and fulfilling, and didn't need any dressing. (I only discovered the balsamic vinegrette at the bottom of the dish later.) They are proud of their onion rings, which are not as greasy as most, with chunks that are thick and not stringy. But like all such dishes, it's still more crust of fried oil than onion, and thus not for me. But then, I've never really enjoyed onion rings anywhere, so it's hardly the fault of the Rosebud Diner.</p>

<p>However, I am a fan of french toast, and I'm sorry to say that the variant at the Rosebud Diner is worse than ordinary. Lacking sugar or cinnamon, it's slightly too eggy, giving it a off-taste, and the bread is plain. I liked the steak fries, which are so free of grease that I actually asked if they were baked, but they are plain, with no spice. Helen tells me that many restaurants don't clean their fryolaters regularly, which may explain why they lack that oily feel.</p>

<p>I also sampled a veggie fritatta that comes with Hollandaise sauce which they make themselves. I find the crust too dry, but the inside very wet, basically egg with too few vegetables, and no spices that I can taste. That much egg is overwhelming and I did not find it interesting and full of diced up surprises as it should be. The homemade Portuguese soup was the opposite. It was warm and complex with a lots of components to keep you busy, although its chunks of meat were a little too small to chew and savor.</p>

<p>My favorite was their Boston cream pie, which was perfect. The chocolate was not too rich and blended well with the cream and moist cake, with no one flavor overwhelming the others.</p>

<p>Overall, the menu gave me the same impression as the decor. There is a lot of love in this place, but the charm sometimes misfires and I just don't sense the complex and masterful strokes of a restaurant with a crafted theme. Instead the food seems "directionless". They should know that you have to dice the vegetables bigger in the frittata, so you can tell they're there. They should add some panache to their french toast, more vanilla, and use extra-thick slices of bread. So the place, both the food and the atmosphere, seem thrown together in a way that's completely well meant and with great hospitality, yet just doesn't compete with the hundreds of restaurants within a 20-minute walk of Davis Square, unless you have a special nostalgia for diners.</p>

<p>By the way, the Rosebud Diner also has a back area I never knew existed, the Rosebud Bar. It is a huge bar and roomy dining area, with videogames, Internet jukebox, pool tables, and a live music stage. Since they have a separate kitchen, a different menu, and a different entrance, it is basically a second operation. So I took photographs but otherwise it did not impact this review. It looked like a presentable but ordinary bar, not classy enough to bring in young college graduates, but notable for its live music Wednesday to Sunday and karaoke on Tuesdays.</p>

<p>There aren't that many vegetarian restaurants near Boston, although some like The Elephant Walk have a sizeable vegetarian menu, and there's a reason why: most of us aren't crazy. Err -- most of us aren't vegetarians, I mean. Did I say crazy? I meant special. Specially tempted to use words like "cleansing" and "holistic", or even worse, "animal testing" and "PETA".</p>

<p>When I meet Bratt Fermeglia, the manager of the Cambridge location, which opened in October 2010, he does use the word cleansing, and describes Life Alive as fast food but healthy, with a cuisine that's "California macrobiotic". I sort of roll my eyes mentally while trying to keep a straight face. I've learned that organic food is sort of a corporate cult. You believe it's healthier because it's marketed that way, in spite of scientific evidence that it isn't.</p>

<p>But I have Life Alive all wrong. "I'm a meat eater," Bratt confesses, and so is Heidi Feinstein, the owner, who founded the cafe and has run its other location in Lowell for 7 years. "Although the menu is all-vegetarian, and mostly vegan, most of our clients eat meat every day."</p>

<p>"So you're saying that I'm safe here," I ask, nervously looking around and only half-joking, "as a guy who doesn't use drugs and can't pronounce 'namaste'?"</p>

<p>To my great surprise, Bratt says yes. "I've worked a lot of places, and this is the truest, the most no-nonsense place I've ever worked for," Bratt says. "The employees all share a role in the creative growing of the business, but we don't have a political agenda to promote or a clique to police. We just want to serve comfort food, whole food, and have customers who say they feel better when they eat here."</p>

<p>In other words, Life Alive is really accessible, a gateway to the vegetarian world for those who want to explore it, while also being a real home to those already in the lifestyle. I believe it. For example, Bratt has no problem with my joking knowingly about a certain local coffeehouse where the staff play music that's so indie it drives out anyone older than 25, and you may find yourself sitting in cramped quarters next to a loitering, drunken homeless guy that the staff is too liberal ("we are all citizens of Planet Earth!") to ask to leave. And there is a certain trendy cafe in Davis Square where the staff get irked if you don't realize it's pick-up and ask them to walk 10 feet to drop off your meal. At Life Alive, while there's no table service, each meal is brought to you, even if you're downstairs.</p>

<p>So Life Alive is different, and the music and interior design mirror that intention. It's two-level, with a cafe feel upstairs and a lounge in the basement with a performance space that doubles as a large play area for kids. Parents will be enthusiastic to hear this because few restaurants -- I can only think of one in Cambridge, Full Moon -- have such a space. And Life Alive's playspace is larger than Angora Cafe's in Boston, if anyone is keeping track. Life Alive is well lit, with modern colors that blend together. It feels very much like, you know, in the 1960s people had such a boom of creativity that they went off the deep end with swirls and flowers that became garish. Now, in the 2010, the liberal movement is more established, and we're not only creative, we're classy. I was sad that the Hollywood Express, the video rental place, was gone, but seeing this place I have recovered. Life Alive practically pulses with happy energy, and you have got to check out the paintings. If this place doesn't cheer you up, consider medication. </p>

<p>The cushions and chairs in the basement lounge are comfy but the space is more brightly lit and has more back support than the cushions at the nearby Elephant Room. They play trance and ambient on the speakers, happy music, and they have live music Thursdays, which range from funk to reggae to down tempo music. Although the live music can sometimes be loud, they don't use amplifiers, so if you sit upstairs, you can talk and treat the music as background anytime.</p>

<p>One feature of the upstairs "bar" -- they serve beer and wine, but aren't allowed to serve coffee because they share the same building with the 1369 Coffeehouse -- is an entire display of fresh vegetables. I comment to Bratt that I never buy vegetables because by the time I get around to the chore of cooking them, half have gone bad in the fridge. "I get you," he says. "I've stopped shopping for fresh vegetables myself, because I don't need to. I can get them here."</p>

<p>"Are you ready to try some food?" he asks. I'm not exactly sure what kale is. I brace myself. I am ready.</p>

<p>Unlike the entrees, where the juxtaposition of different flavors adds counterpoint, the drinks come completely blended and with no real texture. I have one word for the drink called "Life Alive": <b>no</b>. It's decorative, with a red on red swirl that's worthy of a Tim Burton movie, but I guess I am just not hip enough for beet juice. It tastes like a massive beet that someone has mistakenly juiced instead of a fruit. It's awful if you are expecting a sweet drink like lemonade. But if you are expecting a V8-style vegetable drink... it's still pretty bad: bitter and without salt or spice.</p>

<p>However, the Vibrance Alive, while an acquired taste you have to get used to, was wonderful. It's frothy like a room temperature smoothie. The main taste is ginger, but it's got distinct, complex layers to it, like an art film you have to watch several times to get all the hidden meanings. It's possible that with practice I'd get used to the Elvis Alive, a mix of peanut butter and cocoa, but I found the peanut part of the mix too sharp and dominant.</p>

<p>Phew. So far, so California macrobiotic. Let's try some entrees. Every entree here is served warm and has a whole grain base, mixed with vegetables and sometimes a sauce or nuts, which you can get as a half-wrap, a full wrap, or a bowlful. Every entree includes root vegetables (going down into the ground) with stalk vegetables (standing right up), and has the right balance of protein and whole wheat. "There's more protein in one of our sandwiches than a chicken sandwich at most places," Bratt tells me. That sounds too good to be true, but who knows? It might be. I decide not to spoil the illusion by asking him for the numbers.</p>

<p>The Adventurer is the local favorite, and it's mine, too. It tastes like an Asian rice dish, but with interesting, hearty whole grains that taste better than brown rice. It has a soy sauce that's not too salty, and it's served warm and crunchy with beet cubes that don't dominate. Hot damn! This is where I start to be truly won over by Life Alive.</p>

<p>The Healer is the most basic of the dishes I tried. It smells great because it's sprinked with lemon rind dust, and it's slightly blander because it comes with no sauce, but you can really taste the healthy, wholesome grains. This kind of pure taste is what Bratt was talking about when he used the word 'cleansing'. It's a word I might start to use too. I do get the idea that I would feel better eating here than at Subway Sandwich Shop, Jared notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The Goddess dish comes with a creamy sauce and is crisper, with chunks of carrot. The Swami -- wow! -- I just like smelling this dish! It's delicious and filling, like eating a real meal. I can't recall ever having a vegetarian option that's made me feel completely satisfied before. There are several here.</p>

<p>As well as huge salads, and some sides like raw fruit, tofu, and nuts, Life Alive serves grilled tortilla wraps. I try one, the Hot & Healthy Bachelor, which includes eggs -- that's meat in my book! -- and it has a pure, great smell. This smells just as good as an egg muffin from Dunkin Donuts but it tastes so much better, like it won't sit like a brick in my stomach and I won't feel regret about this later. The broccoli is perfectly chewy, neither too raw nor overcooked, blended and moist, a wonderful combination.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I'm floored by Life Alive, and I don't seduce easily. I just reviewed the Rosebud Diner in Somerville, and said that their good intentions fall short because they just aren't crafting masterpieces of food. I felt guilty about that, but coming to Life Alive, now I know that I was right. Everything I try here (except perhaps the drinks) feels <em>crafted</em>, with a taste and texture that are masterfully mixed, shaped with a deliberate direction in mind. The chunks were just the right size and had just the right variety for the mouth feel, chew, and crunch to blend.</p>

<p>In short, even though I'm a meat eater, I might start coming back to Life Alive -- <em>a lot</em>. When I reviewed Angora Cafe, a similar place, they earned 4.5 stars. Life Alive deserves a perfect 5 in my "cafe/pub" category (<a href="/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html">about our ratings</a>), pegging every single category while at the same time avoiding being preachy. Please, Heidi, will you buy out the 1369 Coffeehouse, too? I think we need more places like Life Alive in Cambridge.</p>

<p>I knew I was going to enjoy reviewing Picante Mexican Grill, because I dated a Mexican graduate student who liked the place and I'd been many times in the distant past. I met owner Richard Faulkner one morning just before they opened for lunch.</p>

<p>The place, while small, looks far less corporate than Chipotle or Quito's, with decently authentic stuff on the walls and an open kitchen. There's no table service, and you must bus your own plate, putting your dish and your trash in separate containers, but at least they have metal silverware.</p>

<p>The business was founded in 1990, and Richard was originally an investor, but he sold his florist business and became the owner in 1997. He encourages employees to create the menu, and feels they have more variety to their menu than competitive places like Boca Grande and Anna's Tacqueria. "They mostly have tacos, burritos, and taco salads," he says. "Here we have carnitas plates, chilis, fish on Fridays, and regular specials, like the carnitas verdes today." And they have a free salsa bar.</p>

<p>"We have fresh meat shipped in daily," he tells me, "except Sunday, and 90% of our products are fresh. We prep all day long, and have a casual atmosphere, with friendly staff and great food."</p>

<p>They make their own food in house -- spices, beans, rice, steak, and chicken -- with a cuisine that Richard calls "fast food done well." They offer catering to places as far as 25 miles away.</p>

<p>I try a sample plate, which came out instantly. The carnitas verdes was juicy, really good, with an unusual, very ethnic flavor. It's slightly salty, like pulled pork but of course it is steak.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I find the beans below average, uninteresting, without the smooth blended texture I've come to expect. The chicken with roast poblano came in a delicious cream sauce, and it was the spiciest dish I ate, but the vegetables were limp, overcooked. The steak sample itself was somewhat plain, a good chew with no gristle, but no flavoring either and it came in strangely sized chunks that were too small to really bite into.</p>

<p>The pappas came with red and green peppers, onions, potatos, and mild chili sauce, which had a good mouth feel -- the potato melts in your mouth -- but it was bland. The limeade was wondrous, sweet but also sour, sharp & interesting, served with ice (why does everyone put ice in drinks in the winter?), and it became sharp towards the bottom of the cup, making me wonder if it was poorly blended. Still, it's damn good limeade for $2.</p>

<p>The guacamole and chips could have been served at a bar. If anything has been added to the guacamole, I can't taste it, and the chips are cold and generic. If they make these chips here on site, I'd be very surprised.</p>

<p>In sum, Picante Mexican Grill does not match my memory. I remember I used to love the sauces here, but I try every one anew and didn't find one that I liked. The texas salsa is okay, but uninspired.</p>

<p>What happened? Has Picante Mexican Grill changed in the last few years, or have I just been spoiled by going to El Pelon Taqueria in Brighton, which is a masterful combination of fast but delicious food? I would say that if you want mainstream meals like burritos, you are better off going to Anna's Tacqueria or Boca Grande, which serve them piping hot and rich. If you want off-beat and ethnic specials, like the carnitas verdes, Picante Mexican Grill is an inexpensive and convenient alternative to restaurants... but still, if they cannot get beans, chips, and salsa right... how much love can I give?</p>

<p>Although it would not compete in the restaurant category, I am satisfied to give it a decent rating in the pub/cafe tier <a href="/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html">(about our ratings)</a>, which is where we categorize places without table service.</p>

<p>It's a scoop! Events INSIDER is first to review this destination, and the first thing that strikes you about Thelonius Monkfish is the clever name. Owner Jamme Chantler is not concerned about rights, since jazz legend Thelonius Monk has been dead now for 30 years. "I have conservative partners," he tells me, "who wanted a traditional name like 'Yellowtail', and I wanted to call it Monkfish. They sent me to a Chinese numerologist and fortune teller who didn't like Monkfish. The letters didn't have the right numbers for luck. So I thought and thought -- I wanted to play jazz, and the letters behind Thelonius Monkfish are lucky, it turns out."</p>

<p>It's not an insane idea. While they don't have live music events, jazz plays on the speakers, and the King of Thailand is an accomplished jazz composer and musician. So: jazz and Thailand. They go together. Chef Chudapa Phomjun hails from Thailand and trained with a master chef at Haru Sushi in Boston, the reknowned sushi place.</p>

<p>Speaking of monks, Jamme fell in love with the Thai cuisine while visiting a friend in Thailand who was becoming a Buddhist monk. According to tradition, you have to be a monk for 3 months before getting married. (Scratch Buddhism off my list of alternative religions, but it's still better than compulsory military service in Greece or Israel.)</p>

<p>The interior is upscale but not formal, reminding me of nearby India Pavilion. You could be proud to bring your family or a date here, especially with the delightful short tables where you can sit Japanese-style on cushions! Yet, you would not be ashamed to wear shorts and a t-shirt here either. In fact, the staff are all somewhat dressed down in wrinkled shirts. I make a joke about ironing and Jamme tells me that they want to avoid the crisp, tucked in shirts that make a restaurant look formal. In fact, he confides to me, these shirts are <em>designed</em> to be wrinkled. This is either true or it is the most wonderfully daring bullshit that a restauranteur has ever laid on me. Either way, amusing!</p>

<p>There's a skylight, but it's dim inside. (I never get the point of intentional darkness, but it seems to be in vogue.) And despite the student pricing, where most entrees are $10-$13 and most expensive is $16, you get cloth napkins and a broad variety of choices.</p>

<p>The first thing they bring out is jasmine tea, which has a wonderful smell that's much preferable to green tea. Reviewing the menu, you'll see the traditional foods you'll expect, like Pineapple Fried Rice, but there are completely new dishes in the menu with fun names like "Mad Monk Noodles", "Seoul Train Fried Rice", and the "Volcano Roll" that is a "California roll topped with Scallion, eel sauce, and dynamite". Dynamite? It's a special sauce, Jamme tells me, not actual TNT. They also have "Gaga's Meat Dress Roll", which is 12 pieces of spicy seafood, wrapped with fresh tuna and served with a spicy sauce.</p>

<p>The first thing I try is the Robin Hood Sushi. Wow! Now this is sushi! I just did a review at Spice & Rice and felt guilty to call their sushi bland. Now I know that I was right. Served with shrimp, this is finger food rather than meant for chopsticks. It's spicy and complex, crunchy with really interesting soft rice.</p>

<p>The Spicy Red Dragon Sushi is perfect too, although a little confusing to eat since shrimp included the tails and it was breaded, so I wasn't sure how much of it I could safely bite into. It has tuna on top, which has a cooling effect offsetting the spicy roll itself. Delicious! You really have to try this!</p>

<p>The Crispy Duck Spring Rolls contain a smooth paste of meat (it's the fried roll that's crispy), served piping hot but not spicy, with a sweet sauce. The Razzmatazz Rolls have a strange spice like you'd find in sausages even though they are chicken -- apparently that's curry I'm sensing. Both appetizers have portions of meat that are too small to really taste. The Zen Dream Soup is a standard asian broth that I didn't eat much of because it has squid in it. (One day I'm pretty sure they'll rise up. I've seen a lot of anime.)</p>

<p>I also tried the Cranberry Fried Rice, which has a cranberry sauce, instead of whole cranberries. I liked the scallion crunch but found the bits of egg and chicken too small to taste. And the meal's taste was masked by the oily sauce from the frying pan. Like all fried rice meals, it was perhaps a touch too greasy and heavy, and it felt small due to being served on a giant plate. It's like the opposite of the psychology of serving food on tiny plates to make yourself feel full.</p>

<p>I liked the Fig Jam Fried Rice better, it has a unique and invigorating smell. The walnuts were a nice counterpoint to the soft rice and it comes with drumstick chicken, so it feels like more of a meal, despite being served on the same giant plate.</p>

<p>The Pad Thai has real chunks of chicken, that are hearty, but avoids being too greasy or eggy. It will enliven you.</p>

<p>I hope they add live music, and I wouldn't give it the highest marks in the "fine dining" category (<a href="/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html">about our ratings</a>). But in the 'restaurant' category, I must urge you to go, go, GO! to Thelonius Monkfish for sushi. And the Thai meals are worth a try, too (you have to cut some slack to a restaurant that has just opened), and I love the happy atmosphere. A lot of restaurants cut corners to make their ethnic cuisine accessible to Americans. Thelonius Monkfish turns that equation into an asset by embracing an American culture that is Thai as well.</p>

<p>Grendel's Den has a place in history, Kari Kuelzer tells me. No, really! Founded in 1971, the restaurant was banned from serving alcohol by a state law allowing churches to object to the sale of alcohol within 500 feet. A frequent customer of Grendel's happened to be Laurence Tribe, the Harvard Law School Professor who later became President Obama's judicial advisor. Mr. Tribe and Kari's parents fought the law all the way to the US Supreme Court, and won, with an 8-to-1 majority and the opinion written by Chief Justice Warren Burger. (Mmm.... burger...)</p>

<p>Today, Grendel's is still there, but the church is <em>gone</em>.</p>

<p>Actually, Grendel's Den is partly gone too. The upstairs area has closed, and Grendel's has no association with Upstairs on the Square except sharing the same building. But there is still the basement level bar and pub, and Kari shows me photos of the 1971 interior that closely match its look today.</p>

<p>It looks a little beat. A bar dominates the space, and the brick and wood are adequately lit, a heating unit sticks out into one of the seating areas, and part of the ceiling is covered with wood planks. The floor is tile and wood, and is partly covered with rugs -- something that's unusual for a restaurant, since rugs are hard to clean. This makes me wonder what they're covering up.</p>

<p>The place feels organic, unplanned. "We don't overhaul our decor unless we have to," Kari says. "It's not out of respect for tradition, just economics." There are two neon beer signs, as though someone didn't realize that it knocks the "classy" right out of a restaurant. There are mirrors on the walls, as though someone wanted to make the place look bigger, but didn't realize that mirrors with round frames just don't do the job. One of the mirrors has today's specials written on it.</p>

<p>Still, you can't beat the outdoor seating in warm weather, next to Winthrop Park, the tiny green space off of JFK Street. Indoors, there are 100 seats including barstools. Old timey jazz plays on the speakers.</p>

<p>So, thanks for liberating our booze from churches in 1983. But what have you done for us lately?</p>

<p>Kari says that the strength of Grendel's Den is value. You get a high quality, sit-down meal for a lot less money here. And being a former full restaurant, it's not like they're merely a bar with aspirations. Kari's parents managed a few restaurants before opening Grendel's, and the recipes are time-tested. All ingredients are made in-house.</p>

<p>The eclectic menu has dishes from all over the world. Kari points out to me dishes that are American, Tex-Mex, vegetarian, Mediterranean, and South American, and they'll have Japanese or Chinese meals occasionally, too. One cuisine they refuse to serve is fried foods. So they serve potato chips instead of french fries. They have fresh fish every day at market prices, sustainably caught or raised.</p>

<p>Is it a better value? Yes. A fancy burger at Grendel's is $7.50, with potato chips. Nearby Mr. Bartley's charges $9-$11.50, but you get real french fries. Four Burgers in Central Square charges $7.50, which can rise to $11 with fries and a few toppings. Riverside Pizza has a cheeseburger plate for $6.50 with fries, and Harvard Square's b.good is $6.29, including fries for $8.50. So the prices don't seem that different, but to be fair, Grendel's has $5 lunches every weekday: sandwiches, soups, burgers, and salads, and specials, which undoubtedly undercut the competition. And they have half-price meals practically every day. And you get table service (which none of the places I mentioned have)... but if you're good hearted, that adds the cost of a tip.</p>

<p>The Nachos Supreme ($8), is a heaping plate of nachos with monterey jack and cheddar cheese, sour cream, chili, guacamole, and salsa. It's a pile that's too hard to eat with your fingers, so you should fork through it. It's above average, very salty chips, smells great, with crunchy onion in the guacamole that makes it interesting, yet the sour cream is ordinary. The chips won't scrape your mouth.</p>

<p>The Buffalo Wings are good, not greasy, served with celery, but the blue cheese dip is too drippy, again feeling "organic", like someone is serving it out of rote without realizing that if it's not viscous, you dip and the sauce flows right off like water. The dip is cooling and a nice offset to the Buffalo sauce, which is ordinary but has just the right level of hotness. The chicken was a little dry.</p>

<p>The Salvadoran Vegetables & Tofu ($8) is a plate of warm vegetables and tofu, served piping hot. I'm not sure if this is by design, but tofu is naturally bland -- a subtrate for spices -- and the dish is weirdly perfect in being bland as well. The veggies have a hint of crunch, but the noodles are plain. I'm sorry to say that I found it tasteless.</p>

<p>I try a Natural Disaster ($8.50), a turkey burger with Swiss cheese, avocado, and Cajun dressing. Although the presentation is basic, and you should skip the generic potato chips, the burger is delicious, invigorating, and it's served with a mango chutney that's really good, sort of a jelly without awkward chunks.</p>

<p>I want so much to like Grendel's Den. I used to love this place in the late 1980s, but as it is, I'm afraid I don't understand the appeal. The meals are inexpensive, but not worth going out of one's way for to save $2-4. Some of the food was interesting, but overall that would not draw me here, either.</p>

<p>Perhaps the saving grace of Grendel's Den is the space itself. "It's our mission to have a welcoming atmosphere," Kari tells me. And I can vouch that it's friendly. Two strangers from different groups introduced themselves to me -- something which hasn't happened elsewhere. There are no televisions to distract you from the people you're with. But they don't hold live music nights here, either.</p>

<p>Overall, with a bar feel and little natural light, maybe Grendel's Den is too comfortable for me. If I had a pair of jeans with rough spot in the knee, I'd wear them, but would I want to eat dinner off of them? What I'd like to see is for Grendel's to charge higher prices -- I don't think people would mind -- and to put that cash into interior decoration. But maybe that's just me? In the pub/cafe tier, they would be acceptable, <a href="/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html">(about our ratings)</a> but I in the restaurant tier, which is where Grendel's says they want to be, I can only give two and a half stars.</p>

<p>Grendel's is holding an 40th Anniversary Bash on April 1st, but besides having a few special menu items, I don't know what the event will be.</p>

<p>Before founding Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg wasted years at Harvard before dropping out. Kwanghyun Yoon, the founder of Shabu-Ya, is ahead of the game. He dropped out of Harvard before even attending.</p>

<p>"I came to the United States to follow The American Dream," he tells me. "First I worked in international banking in Chicago, and then I moved to Boston and applied to Harvard." But it takes time to apply, hear back, and wait for Orientation Day. During that year, his daughter was born and Kwanghyun decided he needed a job. So he dropped out and founded his first restaurant in 1985, Shilla, and then this new place, Shabu-Ya, in 2008.</p>

<p>It's not Facebook, but Shabu-Ya has that a Facebook look and feel. It's fantastically bright, modern but not corporate, and Japanese in that 1960s Moon Future style where the decor all curves. There are two bars, but they don't dominate. One is off to the side, and the other is a self-contained circle whose televisions don't distract the people in the rest of the place who want to pay attention to their friends, not be distracted by a soccer game. The decor is upscale, but with fun colors and happy upbeat music that allow you to relax.</p>

<p>In a heavy accent, Kwanghyun tells me that he can't find a good Korean restaurant in Boston and that Shabu-Ya is his answer. They serve Japanese sushi, Korean entrees, and "shabu shabu", Korean hot pot, which is fun to say. Try it. Shabu shabu. Shabu shabu.</p>

<p>Here's how it works. Every table has a hot plate and a pot of broth, which comes to a rolling boil quickly. Using chopsticks, you put meat or vegetables in the broth and they cook in just a few seconds. Then you remove it to cool, and eat! You get cabbage, bok choi, watercrest, tofu, broccoli, shittake mushroom, and thinly sliced black angus beef. If you worry about such things, you can use one pair of chopsticks for the raw meat and another for eating.</p>

<p>I love it! The beef is delicious, sliced too thin to chew but not to savor. The shittake mushrooms chew a little rubbery but the vegetables are hearty, and so are the thick noodles, although I don't know how anyone eats them without making a mess. And unless you're careful it's easy to burn your mouth. So the interactive meal is a creative idea for a date, but maybe not a first date.</p>

<p>On the side, you're given a "ponzu sauce" that you can keep virgin or sprinkle with condiments. Kwanghyun adds a pinch of scallions and garlic for me, but nothing from the tiny container of Chinese BBQ. "That's too hot for you," he says, and I make my sad pouty face. So when Kwanghyun is not looking I sneak a taste. It's not that hot, but it's alien, a paste that could be powdered pork butt for all I know. I don't add any to the ponzu.</p>

<p>The ponzu is interesting and complex, like my favorite Chinese dip, the King of Soy Sauce that comes with Peking Ravioli. </p>

<p>Then Kwanghyun tells me to sip the broth. "Other restaurants just use tap water in their hot pot," he says, "which has no flavor. Ours you can drink: it is a soup, it is part of the meal. Depending on what kind of broth you have, the taste is totally different." It comes in miso, kimchi, and tomyum flavors.</p>

<p>He is right. The tomyum tastes like hot and sour soup, and the kimchi hot pot is less potent but not plain either, like a vegetable soup that comes with garlic, ginger, Korean radish, scallion, red hot pepper, and onion. He lets the kimchi ferment for 7 days so that it sours just right. I try some actual kimchi. This is the side dish that won the Boston Kimchi Festival, and it has a really potent pickled taste. It is a little too hot and exotic for me, but undeniably good.</p>

<p>Usually Chinese food has a lot of oil and starch, Kwanghyun tells me, but here it's fresh and boiled, without much oil. "I strongly believe that this is the healthy food of the future," he says.</p>

<p>He also serves sushi at reasonable prices, between $10 and $14. I try the dragon maki. The presentation is fantastic -- but although solid, the taste itself was average. The avocado on top cools it, a counterbalance to the spicy inside. It has a good crunch but is just not outstanding. Unfortunately, I did not try any other sushi, but I'm told they have spicier rolls. So maybe I am wrong to judge based on that one dish.</p>

<p>It is a shame that I only tried two entrees. I would have liked a tie-breaker between the one wow and the one good-but-not-wow. But in the restaurant category (not "fine dining", <a href="/restaurants_in_boston/img/about-our-ratings.html" target=_blank>see our ratings</a>) I highly recommend the atmosphere and the adventurous fun of shabu shabu. It's just as upscale and exotic as Korean Restaurant & Garden in Allston but more accessible to those who aren't Korean. With individual tables instead of long rows of shelves, it doesn't pack you in like that place I can't remember the name of, the hot pot place in Chinatown that might be Shabu-Zen. It's a great dinner destination to come to with a group of friends, and they also have a lunch buffet on weekdays for $8.50. Say it along with me. Shabu shabu! Shabu shabu! I want some now!</p>

<p>Doug Ferriman hadn't worked for a restaurant or trained as a chef. He just loved pizza so much in the 1990s that he wanted to study it, craft it, and make it better. Before founding Crazy Dough's in 1999, he spent 6 months traveling New England and eating pizza eveyrwhere. "A lot of our first dates were at restaurants," his wife Melissa tells me. It was the best training he could have had. "If you're not humble, you're going to fail," he tells me. "You can learn a lot if you're humble enough to try." At his first location, he hired the best pizza cooks he could find. And learned.</p>

<p>Now Crazy Dough's has 5 locations, and rather than moving upscale, Doug wants to expand west towards New York City and keep the locations small, suitable for students or staff looking for take out. It's definitely not your first choice for a sit down meal. With bright fluorescents and tomato red decoration, the new Boston College branch feels professional but too corporate, unlike the "local color" place next door, El Pelon Taqueria or the Crazy Dough's location in Harvard Sqauare. There's table seating for 6 plus shelf seats for another 12, and upbeat indie rock and reggae music plays. There's an open kitchen and a television set to sports.</p>

<p>I had arrived early at 2pm, and despite the post-lunch time, when things weren't too busy, the staff left an empty bottle, newspaper, and crumbs on the tables to 2:30pm. The crumpled napkin on the floor got removed with a sweeping at 2:45pm. Of course, this is a new location with presumably new staff. As a reviewer, you get one shot to try to characterize a place, and maybe I just came on a bad day. They don't have table service but will bring the meal out to you if you're sitting down.</p>

<p>I have no reservations about Doug and Melissa's marketing -- it is top rate. A poster on the wall tells you to text crazy4 to 244326 to win a free slice. And the menu is a pitch perfect study in layout, offering appetizers, salads, pizza, calzones, pasta, sandwiches, and a "pizza roll", which is basically a rolled up pizza. What a creative idea to add variety without needing a new station for food preparation.</p>

<p>I'm impressed by Doug's enthusiasm for trying new directions like this. "I want to be an innovative gourmet," he says, "with high quality along the entire process from ingredients to the table." He's even seeking a patent on a special pan he invented, which his salad bowls are baked in. The Crazy Dough Bowl is a salad served in a bread bowl made from the same dough as the pizza. It's another clever idea, in what I sense is a long stream of clever ideas. And yes, Crazy Dough's derives from "Crazy Doug". One of Doug's early stunts was to trade in his car for an old limousine in college, and then cover it with streamers and hire a driver on the weekends to cruise campus like a traveling party. Apparently he understands what college students like. No wonder his branches are next to Boston College, Boston University, Harvard, Berklee, and Emerson.</p>

<p>Every restauranteur claims to make their own ingredients, and some must be exaggerating -- but I don't know which ones. So it's refreshing when Doug and Melissa say that they look for good ingredients anywhere, whether made on site or delivered. They do make key ingredients in-house, caramelizing their own onions, roasting their own pure angus (not hambuger, real chunks of beef), and making their own fresh dough. Their cheese company only takes the best 10% of all milk to make their cheese, Doug says. Is that spin? Don't most restaurants pick good cheese? Sure, if they're restaurants, but maybe not if they're pizza shops.</p>

<p>Crazy Dough's claims to have the only fire grilled pizza in Boston (not brick oven like Bertucci's), but that is a stretch. There are at least two others: Cambridge 1 in Harvard Square and Mistral in Boston. Melissa also tells me that they're the only restaurant in American to offer fire grilled, brick oven, and Sicilian styles, and I don't care if it's true or nearly-true. It's great that they offer so much variety, and they recently won a national award for their pizza. I get a sense that they apply to a lot of awards, but you can't fault that they've won some!</p>

<p>So, what about the food? I try the chicken wings, which were the juiciest I've ever tasted. Apparently they're roasted, not fried. "Nothing is fried here," Doug tells me. They're average oily on the chicken wing spectrum (you will want extra napkins, but the sauce doesn't taste fake), and spicy enough that's it's good to have the ranch and blue cheese dips to cool them down.</p>

<p>If you treat the Crazy Dough Bowl as a bread side dish, it's good -- like the rolls at Bertucci's. But as a salad, well, I wish Doug hadn't offered me the caesar salad, which was boring: just lettuce and crotons, with cheese too finely powdered to taste. The Field Greens, which comes with tomato, onion, and dried cranberries, would surely have been zestier, but if you add dressing and eat the buttery bread, you can't call it healthy.</p>

<p>The presentation was great on all the foods I tried. The toppings on the pizzas are well-distributed, each with drizzles of sauce like a Jackson Pollock painting. The Potato Bacon Cheddar pizza smells just like potato skins: it's juicy and although heavy like any bacon meal will be, not overloaded with cheese. I loved the juicy butternut squash -- an original idea -- and caramelized onion on the Pot Roast pizza, which had a meat chew that was not spicy but complex, layered. Despite the name of the restaurant, I found the dough good but not mind-blowing as I'd hoped. In general the presentation and creativity of the meals exceeded their actual taste, but still -- this goes far beyond the pizza shop into real restaurant territory. My favorite pizza was the Nutty Tuscan, another award-winner, which is tomatoes, caramelized onion, roasted garlic, and pine nuts on really moist garlic-bread dough. Mama mia! Prego! Gratzie! Um... Crustaroma! Alfredo! Pizzalini!</p>

<p>There are restaurants just as good, but in the pub/cafe category, which is the tier for places that don't have table service, Crazy Dough's is superior. Although with their takeout style locale, I can't give them the highest marks for a sit-down meal, try them to cater your next group meeting, as a creative way to spice things up without breaking your budget... and thanks to their marketing savvy, they offer a free pizza tasting. I can taste it now. Linguini! Prego! Cheesolini! </p>

<p>It's important to be earnest. The passion of owner Vinay Kumar and manager Ashis Kumar is unmistakable, and they're so eager to demonstrate the breadth of their menu that they invite me to come to Harvest of India three times. With each visit, it only gets better.</p>

<p>The walls are yellow stucco, and the lighting is not too dark. To me the bright colors clash with the wood carvings, which look out of place and of which one is hung with fake fall-colored leaves. It looks like they spent some money on lighting fixtures but went with their guts instead of hiring an interior designer. (But when I return 2 weeks later, they are renovating, so perhaps I judged too soon.) The restaurant seats 50 people and they have table service and cloth napkins.</p>

<p>Ashis says that the strength of Harvest of India is its food, not the decoration. "We're a place for food lovers," he says, and also draws my attention to their low prices. Their entrees are all $11-$15, more or less at the student level, but there's an inexpensive $7.50 lunch buffet and they'll soon have their liquor license and be able to serve beer and wine.</p>

<p>Although I'm unable to find an unusual background story to Harvest of India -- Vinay has spent 25 years opening restaurants in Boston and this is his latest, opened in late 2010 -- since food is their focus, I take a seat and ask Ashis for his recommendations. He suggests a few, and asks me how spicy I want them.</p>

<p>"Definitely spicy!" I say, which earns me a look like Ashis is worried for me.</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "White Boy spicy, not I'm From the Home Country spicy," which seems to put him at ease.</p>

<p>First out was Dal Tadka, a vegetarian dish served with rice that is basically lentil stew. Wow! This is the best lentil dish I have ever tasted. It's served piping hot and it's a pleasure just to smell it! You can feel your whole body unclench and bloom at the aroma. It's a soft mush, a blend of tiny pieces that you can explore with your tongue and its hearty goodness goes right to the bottom of each taste.</p>

<p>I can't help but notice that Vinay and Ashis are discreetly observing me from across the room as I try to eat. Suddenly I become very self-conscious about the bites that I am taking and whether I am giving false body language cues. Peshawari Naan is bread stuffed with nuts and raisins. It's lively and rich, the nuts soft instead of crunchy, but more like a dessert than a side dish.</p>

<p>The Tandoori Chicken Tikka has fantastic presentation -- served steaming on a metal pan! -- and the taste was suitable, not too dry, but not interestingly spicy. Instead it was rather salty, and chunks of meat don't really make a meal, even taken with rice and bread. However, the Chicken Tikka Masala blew my mind. Wow! Its sauce is viscous, more like a paste than a liquid, creamy and spicy without going over the top. It's got layers of taste so that you get something new in each bite. It was so good that I couldn't stop eating even after I was full.</p>

<p>Two enthusiastic customers who are heading out stop to introduce themselves to me. They are Colleen Chatterton and John Harberstadt. They've eaten at many Indian restuaurants in India itself, in Britain, and in New York. Colleen says, "This is my favorite restaurant in Boston," and it's one of John's two favorites in the Indian category, the other being Annapurna. They like the variety. "You won't find these authentic dishes elsewhere," Colleen says, mentioning Garlic Gobhi (cauliflower cooked with fresh garlic and tamarind) and Hyderabadi Mirchi (eggplant and green peppers with sesame seeds, and peanut and coconut sauce). The Tandoori Duck Masala or Lamb Shanks are unique to Harvest of India, too. The menu is packed with options. Colleen and John don't live nearby, so they aren't just choosing India Harvest out of convenience, and they were so eager to tell me good things about the food that they lost the cab they called (it honked, waited, then drove away). Apparently, you'll also find sensational milkshakes here, too.</p>

<p>The next day I return by invitation to try the buffet. It's all you can eat for $7.50. Food served buffet style (and priced so inexpensively) is bound to be less compelling. So I wasn't surprised that the Chicken Makhaini had good meat but wasn't distinctive, with a sauce that had a tomato soup flavor. The Jayapuri Vegetable was soft and smooth: it melts in your mouth. It was solid but not spicy or complex. The Vegetable Samosa was very good, salty and delightful, with the consistency of mashed potatos. As usual with samosas -- not just here, but everywhere -- I find there's too much dough compared to the filling.</p>

<p>A bite goes down the wrong windpipe and I feel myself about to cough uncontrollably. I look over to the open kitchen and find that Vinay and Ashis are still noticing me. I do my best to cough in a way that communicates, "I love the food, it's just that I'm choking, but most likely will not die and do not need the Heimlich Maneuver."</p>

<p>Overall, the buffet is solid, and I find nothing disappointing, except perhaps the garlic salad, which was already limp at 12:30pm. I tried the garlic naan, which is better for sopping up sauces, and found it soft, but average and (although it was brought out to me, not left in a pile in the buffet) not served hot. The Chana Masala was solid and unusual, a meal made from spice and chickpeas. The fruit salad had just two ingredients that I could taste: apples and black pepper. The combination works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>My favorite is the Madrasi Kofta. Incredible! It's like a supercharged meatball and sauce, with a delicious mouth feel. That complex taste is actually minced chicken. I hadn't been expecting a meal of this quality in the buffet.</p>

<p>By now I've eaten so much that I can't even move. So I sit there trying to digest before saying my goodbye. That's when Ashis comes over and asks if I'd like some rice pudding, the only thing in the buffet I haven't tried. I think they've been monitoring me. Okay, I say, without moving, wondering if maybe he'll bring it to me. He doesn't.</p>

<p>So I sit for a while trying not to breathe too deeply, marshalling myself to get to the buffet. Ashis continues to look at me curiously, no doubt wondering why I don't get up. I get up. I make it to the buffet. I get the pudding. I try a taste.</p>

<p>It's delicious! Most rice puddings that I've had taste like a small mound of Chinese white rice that someone's added sauce to. The mouth feel is too granular, unlike ice cream, which is smooth. The rice pudding at Harvest of India, which has pistachio and is served chilled, you can tell it's rice but somehow it has the creamy mouth feel of a powder mix pudding. It's sweet and I have several bites. I can't help myself. Soon I can't move again.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I reviewed the nearby India Castle, and the manager there was so friendly and sincere that I felt bad for calling the food average. Now I know I was right. Meals at Harvest of India wowed me three times, once of them being a buffet dish, and the low prices make it a destination for everyone. Because of the mismatching decor, I cannot give it a perfect 4 out of 4, but the food there is perfect to my non-Indian taste. I'm so glad that I made the discovery in this out of the way location between Harvard and Central Squares. Trust me, it is worth the trip.</p>

<p>On my way out, Ashis asks if I can bring a printout of my review so that they can hang in the window. He means this sincerely, but it is also the best psych-out that a restauranteur has ever laid on me. Restaurant owners, perk your ears up! Make a sincere face, lead your reviewer to the window, and frame a space with your fingers on the glass. "This is going to be a place of honor for your review," you say, humbly. "Could you bring us a printout?" How could any journalist resist?</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is no need to resist. I am already in love with Harvest of India.</p>

<p>Wagamama. It's fun just to say it, so not wanting to spoil the illusion, I don't ask what it means. This is the first time I've interviewed someone at a restaurant who's not a manager, chef, or owner. Nancy Barret is in charge of marketing, and Wagamama is a chain, founded in London in 1992 and now has branches in Faneuil Hall, the Prudential Center, and Harvard Square. I don't make a joke about Britain trying to re-colonize, because Nancy is a local. She grew up in Peabody and now lives in Charlestown. I spend several minutes trying to find a personal story behind the restaurant and fail. So. It's a chain.</p>

<p>We met in the Harvard location just before opening time. It's a huge clean space that seats 120, that's creative and not too corporate, with an open plan and an open kitchen. With its full height windows, it's bright and cheerful. In the corners, 4 unnecesary televisions are set to the news, not sports. Music plays quietly -- so quietly that it's easily covered by conversation.</p>

<p>Wagamama is a pan-asian restaurant with a Japanese leaning, Nancy tells me. They call it "communal seating" because the tables are connected into low rows. But there's space between the seats about the same that you'd find at any closely packed restaurant of 2-seat tables. Since this is London's version of Asia's cuisine, they focus on making the food accessible rather than purely authentic. That sounds great to me. (What is authentic, anyway? It's like a denial that cultures learn from each other and an insistence that ethnicities are homogenous, combined with a prejudice against progress.) The menu is helpfully labeled with symbols for those who eat vegetarian or have allergies and can't want gluten-free foods.</p>

<p>"We try to keep the menu the same as all the other branches, so that customers get exactly the same experience," Nancy says, and I politely question whether consistency is good in a restaurant whose focus is accessible food (i.e. caters to local tastes), beyond the internal benefits of honing profits. I have an MBA and have no problem with chains -- I like Pizzeria UNO and the Longhorn Steakhouse, for example -- but streamlining and centralizing your business can pull you away from nimbly responding to customer feedback.</p>

<p>"London is a very fast-paced place," Nancy tells me, "and our focus is to serve very fresh food, very quickly, with 30 sauces made in-house." Each server has a handheld device that transmits orders to the kitchen, but it doesn't seem to have an impact. My appetizers came out in 7 minutes and the entrees in 10 minutes and 13 minutes respectively. I wonder if like McDonald's they prep the most popular dishes in advance during busy times, and by coming at 11:30am I am not seeing their best hustle. Customers are given chopsticks but also a fork and a knife without needing to ask.</p>

<p>I tried the Raw Juice first: "carrot, cucumber, tomato, orange, and apple juice". It's $3.95 for a regular size, which thankfully is not a euphemism for "small". It's odd. It tastes like orange juice but has an aftertaste like vegetable juice. There are definitely layers and it keeps your interest, finding cucumber hiding and then emerging. You should drink it quickly, because after a few minutes sitting, it will separate into top and bottom layers.</p>

<p>I quite enjoyed the Duck Dumplings ($7), "served with a cherry hoi sin sauce", which are baked and then deep fried, leaving them almost entirely free of oil but not slippery like the steaming pork dumplings I'm used to at Chinese places. The duck meat is really unusual and has a paste texture. The sauce is sweet and has a kick to it.</p>

<p>The Yasai Katsu Curry ($10) is a vegeterian dish that's approachable and simple, with "deep-fried slices of panko-coated sweet potato, eggplant, and butternut squash, with curry sauce and sticky rice". I enjoyed the large chunks of sweet potato and eggplant, which were fun to cut up and bite into, and it comes with a salad that's sharp and interesting, if slightly bitter. Unfortunately, I found the sticky rice tasteless -- empty calories -- and the curry rather than being a sauce was too "Thanksgiving gravy" for me: too buttery and laid on top rather than mixed in.</p>

<p>The Chili Ramen ($11) was the first item I tried that I really enjoyed, a "spicy broth and ramen noodles topped with chicken, chilies, red onion, bean sprouts, cilantro, scallion", was still hot several minutes after being served. It has a hot smell like kimchi but my server Matt says that's the chili sauce and fish paste. The presentation is wonderful and it's definitely a full meal, with pure chicken that's you can savor. It's got so many complex ingredients that different spoonfuls will have different levels of spiciness.</p>

<p>The Lemongrass Shrimp Soba was too plain for me, ($14, a little pricey for lunch) is "grilled shrimp on noodles stir-fried with cilantro, garlic, chilies, and beansprouts". The meal has no real smell to it, and I found it ordinary. It had the same noodles as the salmon dish, but without a dominating taste, it just made the grease more promiment.</p>

<p>My favorite of the meals I tried was the Teriyaki Salmon Soba ($13.50), "teriyaki soba with salmon, on noodles with curry oil, snow peas, chiles, red onion, scallion, ginger, bean sprouts, and bok choy". It's got a powerful and unusual smell that made me say 'wow', which, although the noodles are the same, buries any greasiness. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the bok choy -- I just don't get the juxtaposition of smooth noodles and flaky salmon that melts in your mouth with a bitter crunchy alien celery.</p>

<p>Overall, Wagamama serves solid, upscale food, with great presentation and reasonable prices. I prefer the atmosphere to the food, but the place is not so friendly that you expect to make friends here or meet the owner. And I can't help but notice that (at the Harvard location) you can find better food and an even more impressive atmosphere upstairs, at Shabu-Ya. I am pleased to give Wagamama an average but no complaints 3.5-star restaurant rating.</p>

<p>Humility is attractive. At the Rosebud Diner in Somerville, the owners gave me the full squeeze, with photos, newspaper clippings, and awards going back to the 1940s. At Leo's Diner, I've been asking co-owner Richie Bezjian for personal stories for 20 minutes before he offers up this gem:</p>

<p>"Ben Affleck got us on Oprah. And Katie Couric."</p>

<p>What? Could you back up and explain that?</p>

<p>Leo's Diner is Harvard Square's oldest restaurant, founded in 1949 by Charlie, the guy behind Charlie's Kitchen. Through high school in the late 1970s, Richie and his brother and co-owner Raffi worked nearby in a coffeehouse with live music, and decided to stay in the business. Then one day, the bread delivery man -- like hairdressers, they know all the gossip! -- mentioned that the owner of Leo's Diner wanted to retire. But at ages 21 and 23, the brothers Bezjian hardly had the experience or the money to take over.</p>

<p>So of course they did anyway, with Leo taking a big chance on them and taking part of the buyout as debt. That was 1982, and they decided as a thank you to keep the name. "It's also my Zodiac sign," Ritchie says.</p>

<p>I've lived in Cambridge since the 1980s, and I have to confess that I've never noticed Leo's Diner before. It's easy to confuse with the bar next door, because they share the same building and basic appearance. It doesn't help that Leo's has bottles in their window (which turn out to be root beer) and some window art that's grassrooty but doesn't jump out at you. With the narrow sidewalks in Harvard Square, competitive signage all around, and us Bostonians walking quickly and staring straight ahead, it would be easy to pass by. </p>

<p>Inside, there's only stool seating, along the wall, the window, and the open kitchen. So it would be awkward to chat with a friend, but you're oriented right in to chat with Richie as he cooks. Perhaps that's why it's so easy to engage with the staff. "We're like a family," Richie says. "We get to know our customers, and sometimes we get the 3rd or 4th generation of our original customers coming in here." Richie tells me that one customer in his mid-80s says he's never had a bad meal here. Classic rock plays on the loudspeakers.</p>

<p>Looking around, the diner is well-lit and bright, with a welcoming decor that includes celebrity photos on the wall, but it doesn't look especially unique. Can it be that well-loved?</p>

<p>Apparently. Richie is good friends with Tom Magliozzi, the co-host of NPR's Car Talk radio show, which is based in Cambridge. "He comes by a lot," Richie says. "My brother and me, we're the same way, always joking around and insulting each other." As proof there's a photo on the wall and one of the meals is named Click & Clack's Noise Pollution. It's a cheeseburger.</p>

<p>Richie also runs through a list of celebrities I've never heard of, but if you're big into music or hockey, you'll know the names, I'm sure.</p>

<p>This is when he tells me about Ben Affleck.</p>

<p>You're kidding, I say.</p>

<p>"No really," Richie replies. "I watched Ben & Matt grow up, I know their families." When Ben Affleck did a celebrity segment on Oprah about his hometown, he brought the TV crew here. His favorite dish is the double cheeseburger plate. "Then he went behind the counter to cook it, which was a disaster of course," Richie says, smiling. Then in 2004, then when the Democratic National Convention came to Boston, Katie Couric was in town to cover it, and Ben Affleck brought her here, too.</p>

<p>While I'm still reeling from this information, Richie tells me about the food as though nothing is out of the ordinary. "I take pride in what I do," he says. Pointing to the open kitchen, he says, "Everything is cooked right in front of you and we don't own a microwave." They make their own recipes and don't buy anything frozen. They make their own soups and salads from scratch and offer unique foods like a yogurt-based chicken rice soup with mint, a red lentil soup with asparagus, carrot, and garlic. "And we make homemade gazpacho. Who does that these days?" he says.</p>

<p>The theme of the diner is all-American, or Mediterranean. Or just Diner, since the napkins are very thin and water is served unceremoniously in a paper cup. The bathroom in the basement is clean but it's fallen into disrepair, and it looks like the last renovation was an amateur job some time ago. While Leo's Diner is very much a breakfast and lunch place, you could catch an early dinner here before they close at 7pm.</p>

<p>So! Let's eat. Richie cooks and serves up several plates while I look around wondering how much time I'd have to spend eating here to be around the next time someone famous comes in.</p>

<p>The Unique Dominique ($9.25) is a "Broiled BBQ chicken topped with cheddar cheese, sauteed onions, & peppers." It's hearty, with a simple, thick slab of chicken, but the bread is plain and there's nothing distinctive about the presentation or sauce. I wouldn't be happy paying $9.25 for a sandwich of this quality or size.</p>

<p>The Steak Plate ($7.95 plain) is much better. Richie cuts the steak himself from flank meat, and the small pieces are delicious, with no gristle or fat. Although the french fries, cheese, and roll it's served on are basic -- the meal is joyous and archetypical of the "diner" experience. It's filling and not greasy, but still, with onions, green peppers and cheese, it comes to $10 and is on the small side.</p>

<p>The first meal that got my attention was the Challah Bread French Toast ($6.25), with a great smell of cinnamon & powdered sugar. It's served with a (unfortunately small portion of) real fruit, and is solid, managing to avoid that sicky, overpowering egg taste. It's good but not a wow.</p>

<p>I very much approve of the Mediterranean Omelet ($7.25). The price is right and it comes with hash browns and toast, which, although ordinary, at least they're not greasy. The omelet itself is really good, the best thing I tried at Leo's Diner. It's got powerful ingredients: moist tomato, salty and pure olives, and despite the egg, with the toppings mixed in it avoids being too heavy.</p>

<p>As for the Diego's Salad ($9.25), you don't even have to eat it to tell that it is glorious. Although the chicken was dry, there's enough meat to make it a real meal, and the feta cheese and crisp lettuce make it interesting. It doesn't need dressing, and comes with only the thinnest sprinkling of Italian. Still, this is an $8 salad.</p>

<p>The only item I tried that I didn't care for was the yogurt based chicken rice soup. It was refreshingly hot, but too salty, even before I added the saltines served on the side.</p>

<p>Every restaurant owner tells me that he has a welcoming environment and the best, freshest food. At Leo's Diner, I'll take the former. While the food is priced "restaurant" but sometimes falls to "diner" quality, I can tell from the traffic in and out that the people who eat here really have formed a small community.</p>

<p>I get it. Leo's Diner simply isn't outstanding, but if you make friends with the staff, you become loyal for life. If you are a tourist looking for a local to chat with a Harvard Square regular hoping to make friends, you'll get more attention here than at the bustling Mr. Bartley's around the corner, in an environment that is more cheerful than Grendel's Den down the street, which has the dark and heavy feel of a bar. Leo's Diner is "real", unlike so many corporately sanitized places around. I'll give it a solid though average rating in our Pub/Cafe tier (not the 'restaurant' tier, see our ratings).</p>

<p>And who knows? Become a regular and perhaps Ben Affleck will walk in with another TV crew.</p>

<p>If Harvard Square were the North Pole, this would be Santa's Workshop. Amongst all the restaurant and diners in Harvard Square, here is one devoted to <em>dessert</em>! Unlike "hole in the wall" ice cream shops with plastic bowls and sticky tables, Finale ("Tom Brady's favorite dessert place") takes the dessert concept and spins it into a classy night spot that also serves food and alcohol. Perhaps it's such a good idea because it was dreamed up as a What If class project in 1996 by three Harvard MBA students. Then they decided to make their Candyland real.</p>

<p>The place seats 65 with comfortable spacing and has soft yellow and red colors that don't feel corporate: it's more like a spin-off of the Harvard faculty club. It's upscale but not overly formal, and unlike a bar, it is well lit, with large windows covering an entire wall. The music, played on speakers, is too quiet to cover the conversation on the other side of the room as I sit down to talk with Marketing Manager Brandon Rigolini and Executive Pastry Chef Nicole Coady. Nearby, there's a pastry prep station with a mirror overhead, so you can watch staff making cakes and platters. Finale is launching a new menu in May, and has three locations: Harvard Square, Coolidge Corner, and Park Plaza, with a "tasting" every month at the Brookline location.</p>

<p>Brandon assures me that alcohol is not their focus, but I'm skeptical at first, having seen the wine rack that spans one entire wall and bottles on display all around the room, including two oversized giants that practically shout "Driiiiiiink. Drink NOW". The menu also tilts towards alcohol, with three pages of alcohol. The non-alcohol half of the menu, also 3 pages, contains desserts and appetizers that are each followed by a recommended wine.</p>

<p>But I take Brandon's point. It's too classy and bright to be bar where you come to get wasted, listen to loud music, and pick someone up. And unlike a bakery, it's got table service and elegant meals, although you can get take-out in their front foyer. Unlike a sit-down restaurant, it's okay to stay for a long conversation, and unlike a coffeehouse, the tables aren't packed together with people using the space for free to type on their laptops. It's something unique, a miraculous combination where it's okay to linger with friends, while being served upscale food in an upscale atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is not an accident. Nicole, who joined Finale in 1998, has a vision for everything I see, surely a product of a singular, thematic vision from the restaurant's founders. Her energy is bright and infectious. There are staff nearby but she hops up and refills my water herself. (Now that is a manager leading from the front!) She calls herself a "small town girl from Western Virginia", but that's humility speaking. In truth she's a grill and saute chef from big name Johnson & Wales and a former biologist who understands the chemistry behind complex cooking.</p>

<p>Nicole introduces me first to the non-dessert items on their menu, which are real entrees. She tries to tie every entree to Finale's "sweet" theme, and to keep the portions small so that guests have room for a dessert as well. (Yet the sandwiches come with a little square of fudge.)</p>

<p>The Apple Mango Sandwich ($6.50), "sliced apple, mango chutney, goat cheese, caramelized onions, arugula, and walnuts on multigrain" has a great smell to it. Soft and hearty, this is really good bread! It's rare to find the bread delicious by itself in a sandwich. The combination is complex, interesting, but doesn't fill you up. I would never have guessed that apples, goat cheese, and nuts would go so well together. Nicole tells me that it's a customer favorite that's inspired some to make it themselves at home.</p>

<p>The Turkey Club ($7.29), "smoked turkey, Gruyère cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato with mustard mayo on focaccia" also has excellent bread, a kind of french loaf that is wonderfully soft. The bacon and mayonnaise taste don't dominate, but the deli meat, sliced thin and slick (as all deli meat is), is easily lost and doesn't have a meat chew feeling to it. I always wonder why delis choose slices over chunks of turkey. Is it cheaper sliced thin from a "loaf" of meat? Am I in the minority to prefer turkey sliced thick, Thanksgiving Dinner style?</p>

<p>Lunch at Finale goes to 4pm and most sandwiches can be grilled into paninis. I next sample some non-dessert foods from their dinner menu. </p>

<p>The Meatloaf Sliders ($11), are "veal meatloaf with arugala and Gruyere cheese served with sweet potato wedges and jalapeno mango sauce". In other words, tiny burgers of meatloaf on buns. They come with a warm, wake up smell and taste so good that I forget to take photos! The sauce comes on the side and it's mind-blowing - not too citrusy, it's like a very potent relish that Satan corrupted but Jesus saved. The sweet potatos fries aren't greasy, because they're baked, and they're thick but need salt or some kind of spice. Like all meatloaf, the meat has a smooth texture, and it's spicy and interesting.</p>

<p>I also forget to take photos of the Finale Short Ribs ($15), "boneless short ribs rubbed witih Valrhona cocoa and lily coffee, braised in dark beer and caramelized onions, served with roasted carrots and yellow potatoes," being distracted by the extremely important business of eating them. This was the first WOW meal I tried at Finale, and this from a guy who neither drinks coffee nor beer. It's served piping hot and is remarkably hearty. You feel like Olaf the Massive Viking chewing into it and it breaks apart in your mouth with no strings and only a few fatty bits. Although the potatoes are undercooked, leaving them slightly crunchy (Finale is such a fancy place that I make sure with Nicole that this was a real oversight, not an arty attempt to present the food differently), it is served in a gravy sauce that will open your eyes wide.</p>

<p>Everything is served with an impeccable presentation that could not be more creative. Not only is each dish colorful and laid out decoratively, each dish is different from every other dish. I tried a cookie plate that is made to share that comes with a blackberry float, a combination of sherbet and seltzer water which tasted as expected. Among the varieties of cookie, the sugar cookie, Nicole tells me, comes from her grandmother's recipe. I look around to make sure the grandmother isn't haunting me as I discover that it's not soft enough for me. With the other cookies, served gloriously warm and soft, something is slightly off taste... too much butter? Needs vanilla? I can't tell. It's my job to know these things, but the complexity of every item I try at Finale sometimes stupifies.</p>

<p>The next item looks joyfully plucked from a Dr. Seuss book. Surely this is art, and I admire it for a while before digging in. Manjari Mousse (plated desserts are $7 to $12) is "bittersweet Valrhona chocolate mousse layered with chocolate buttermilk cake and French apricot puree, served with a Napoleon of blackberry cabernet sorbet and strudel dough." This one's just right, striking a balance between sweet and bitter, and between carbohydrate cake and dairy filling.</p>

<p>Although I was craving a chunk of homogenous apple pie, something basic like you'd find at a diner or bakery, you won't find any such simplicity here. The Apple a La Mode (plated desserts are $7 to $12), is "warm and lightly spiced Macintosh apple and cranberry tart served with Tahitian vanilla gelato, lavender soaked hazelnut financier and honey caramel sauce." Although not the diner style apple pie I am hoping for, it's undeniably good, with unusual clusters of brown sugar, smooth and thoroughly cooked apples, with a peanut brittle wafer.</p>

<p>Like all the plated desserts (full size desserts served on a plate, not as a side), these last two are meant to be split between two people, and they have gluten free options on the menu, too. I notice that none of the desserts come with drizzled chocolate or butterscotch sauce. I ask Nicole and she says that's on purpose, and I quite approve. Although decorative, drizzle is hard to eat and smears. (Also, as with my Midwest Grill review, one is tempted to life the plate and lick it, despite the glare of one's date.) None of the dishes I try at Finale become too messy to eat on a first date.</p>

<p>I also try a number of pastry size desserts, which are $5 or $6 brought to your table, or you can get a gift box of several to go at $4.50 each. </p>

<p>The Boston Cream Cake was not what I was expecting at all. I so love Boston Cream Pie, and I see it on the menu, but no doubt it too is not served in the diner style that I'm used to. The cake is real cake, of course, dominated by a mint taste that was not for me.</p>

<p>The Chocolate Symphony is much better, "three tiers of Valrhona chocolate mousse (bittersweet, milk and white) with chocolate cake". The cake itself is moist with chocolate that goes deep down to your bones. It's complex and layered, so that every bite is different, yet it is not too sweet.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Chocolate is even better, "bittersweet chocolate mousse layered with chocolate buttermilk cake", yet it is the only item I tried at Finale that was too sweet to finish. I definitely wouldn't want the sugar rush from a larger portion.</p>

<p>The cheesecake is a lot softer than it appears and unlike anything else I try at Finale it's pure, with one homogenous flavor. It's not too sweet but slightly too rich for me, and lacks the crumb crust to offset that richness. (But they have a blueberry version that does come with a crust.) A lot of cheesecakes are too dry. Do you know what I mean? It sticks in your mouth like peanut butter and you need to take several gulps of water to wash it down. This cheesecake doesn't have that problem, a trick I am not sure how they accomplished, but I am learning to expect miracles from Nicole.</p>

<p>The tiramisu is "coffee-soaked ladyfingers with rich mascapone mousse, topped with Valrhona cocoa powder". Even looking at it, I don't see anything resembling a finger, or a lady's finger, but it's a pure whipped mousse with cocoa that's still finely powdered. I'm not a coffee drinker but it didn't strike me as too 'coffee' in its taste. Instead it's got an interesting combination from the infinitely smooth mousse and the fine particles of cocoa like eating direct from a can of powder. You'll enjoy running your tongue through and through it before swallowing.</p>

<p>Also on the "What is this?" list is the creme brulee. I can't even spell creme brulee without looking it up, but the "vanilla cream caramelized a la minute by our chefs, garnished with orange butter cookies and fresh fruits" is basically a custard, exceptionally smooth and with a crust of sugar on top.</p>

<p>The last thing I try is the Molten Chocolate ($11), "baked-to-order warm chocolate cake with a gooey center, served with coffee gelato, milk chocolate almonds and Valrhona chocolate sauce." There is a delicious mouth feel to the viscous chocolate sauce, which mixes perfectly with the cake-like crust, and the nuts are soft and not crunchy (which would clash). It's smell is to die for and again it's not too sweet. I even liked the coffee "gelato", though I generally dislike coffee and its ice cream variants.</p>

<p>Once I used to believe that all Chinese food was served street vendor style, because the only Chinese restaurants I knew sort of pushed it out. In the same way, the only desserts shops I know are holes-in-the-wall that sort of push their products out. Why assume that dessert must be simple? Ultimately, Finale is serving not just a menu category but a genuine cuisine, and one that you must be in the mood for.</p>

<p>I admit it, sometimes I'd rather go to IHOP for basic pancakes or buy an apple pie that only has 3 ingredients: apples, cinnamon, and crust. There is a certain relaxation in knowing that what you're going to get is what you're used to. But Finale is not your grandmother's kitchen, and it's not a bakery. You don't come to Finale unless you want "an experience". You come here wanting an adventure and great conversation with friends in a bar-like atmosphere that is yet classy and bright. Just like you choose your Chinese restaurants, sloppy or classy, here is the classy alternative to J.P. Licks and Rose's Bakery. Although I did find hiccups in the occasional item at Finale (for example a bitter/sweet combo instead of pure sweetness), they were all because of cuisine I wasn't perhaps in the mood for, not because of a lack of excellence.</p>

<p>So while you can't make Finale a substitute for Ben & Jerry's, when you're in the mood for its complexity and atmosphere, it can't be beaten. I sampled more than a dozen menu items and spent nearly an hour interviewing Nicole and Brandon. Looking for flaws, I found none. I am delighted to give Finale a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.</p>

<p>"If my college buddies and I did the things <em>here</em> that we did in India, we would have been sent to juvenile detention," Sajal tells me. Sajal Latka is the co-owner of Maharaja, the new Indian restaurant in Harvard Square. He founded the restaurant with two friends from India and he tells me discreetly that they had quite a few antics back in the day.</p>

<p>"Like what?" I ask innocently, pen ready.</p>

<p>"Well, I have kids now," he tells me, "so I don't want them doing any of the things I did. Maybe we shouldn't talk about it."</p>

<p>"Right," I chime in. "Of course." I let my pen and pad drop low enough that they are under the table and less obvious. "So... like what?"</p>

<p>It turns out that their college, one of India's top schools, had a mandatory attendance rule. If you weren't in class 75% of the time, you couldn't take your final exams. You would fail all your classes. But Sajal and his friends lived the student life that is the same everywhere in the world. Classes started at 8am and that was still hangover time.</p>

<p>So, come final exam month, they were in trouble, and even bribing teachers with bottles of rum wasn't working. And instead of studying, they were goofing off.</p>

<p>"Both my friends' father and my father were retired army officers, tough guys, so we couldn't tell them how much trouble we were in," he says. "We had to think of something."</p>

<p>The master plan they contrived was to stage hunger strike. To hear him tell the story, it sounds like Sajal may not have gone on strike personally. Instead, he and his friends recuited kids to go on strike instead, starting on their local campus and soon spiraling to include schools in other cities. The students protested that they hadn't been given enough notice of the mandatory attendance rule. It snowballed out of control, becoming a sensation in the news, and then the political movement of the month nationwide. It was a lot of revolutionary fervor from one tiny desire to get out of trouble and a lot of hype.</p>

<p>I decide that this is awesome. Hey, if smart kids did well on exams, it shouldn't matter whether they went to class.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, if Sajal's kids are reading this, stay in school. <em>Stay in school, kids!</em> I'm glad we have that straight.</p>

<p>Okay, back to his story. Sajal and his friends dreamed of running a restaurant but didn't have any money. But they did move to the United States and work in hotel management. Finally in 2002 they had the cash to buy the existing India Palace restaurant in Manchester, NH, and then opened branches in Nashua, NH and Chelmsford, MA. Soon they were ready for the big leap to Cambridge.</p>

<p>Despite searching for years for a space in Harvard Square, they found this new location almost accidentally on Craigslist. "We shit in our pants when we saw the rent," Sajal tells me. Without daring to think too long and let the place get taken, just acting on instinct, they grabbed it, hoping to serve the previous customer base of the Bombay Club restaurant that used to be here. Maharaja opened in March 2011.</p>

<p>"So why does Cambridge need another Indian restaurant?" I ask. We have 4 that I can think of and a few that I can't. Sajal replies that Boston lacks a "destination" Indian restaurant, one that is luxurious. Maharaja certainly fits that description. The walls are covered with ornate woodwork, and each table is a pane of glass covering small trays of spices and designs. Even more than India Pavilion, which I think I could argue is a "destination" competitor in Central Square, Maharaja is opulent.</p>

<p>Their cuisine is unsual, too. Sajal tells me it's called "Royal Indian Cuisine", made of dishes collected from the Royal palaces of India. That's what Maharaja means, <em>royalty</em>. Sajal was an army officer's son, and the family was moved many times from town to town. His partner Rohit's father was a retired Brigadier General with a passion for seeking out cooking as well. When you move to a new town, you find that the army base in the middle of nowhere has great amenities, like a golf course and swimming pool. So the local VIPs all want to go to the army base, and you get to know them -- and their cooks! Thus, their experience with Royal Indian Cuisine.</p>

<p>For example, they offer Murgh Wajid Ali, "a royal delicacy from the kitchen of Wajid Ali Shah, chicken breast stuffed with paneer and nuts simmered in a creamy saffron sauce." Sounds very royal, and Sajal points out a number of completely unique meals on the menu, none of which mean much to a White Boy like me.</p>

<p>I think on this for a while. Is "Royal" an authentic cuisine, or is Sajal playing another joke on society, hyping a phrase and hoping it snowballs into a revolution? Sajal confesses that he and his friends did make up the term. But it doesn't matter. If the food is good, and is modeled from the royals, then this is how new cuisines are founded. I think it's a great idea.</p>

<p>Sajal tells me that based on customer feedback, they plan to reduce the menu considerably (75%) to just the favorites, and then add a lunch menu and a dessert menu later. (They do at the moment offer a lunch buffet and have a case of Indian sweets out front.)</p>

<p>I try the Lollipop Chicken ($10), an appetizer that is "a very popular Indo/Chinese snack, chicken wings, stuffed with seafood, sauteed with vegetables and finished in oyster sauce". Wow! It's wondrous, like some genius has taken Buffalo Wings, removed the greasy sauce, stuffed it like a turkey, and added a drumstick handle so you can eat them without getting your hands messy. It's delightfully moist, and has no skin. It comes with a dry slaw that is basically shaved lettuce and carrots.</p>

<p>The Chicken Tikka is a more mainstream meal ($18), chicken breast pieces marinated in yogurt and spices cooked on skewers in the tandoor. Tandoor is supposed to be dry, but the chicken is especially dry, too much so for me, despite the rich, potent smell.</p>

<p>The Khatta Dhuandar Gosht ($19) is lamb cubes and ground lamb smoked and cooked with pomegranate seeds in a piquant sauce. It's delicious, a combination of smooth mouth feel from the ground lamb with a very easy chew of lamb chunks. While it's not quite a "wow", I love the sauce. It was definitely oily, though -- see the lower right photo. (Indian cuisine is often oily, and I love it, but there can be a price to pay later.) Sajal tells me that this meal is completely unique, not to be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>The naan (bread) was soft, but I let it sit for a while and it loses its heat, perhaps because it was served in a room temperature metal bowl (metal conducts heat away quickly).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm not offered anything else on the menu, so I'm left without a complete sense of its range. Normally I can rate a menu with some confidence. Here I am not so sure. Compared to other places in our "Dining Experience" tier, Maharaja's prices are low. Compared to other places in our "Restaurant" tier, it is pricey -- and this is the tier for Maharaja, because despite the amazing decor, you don't have to dress up to go, and there's no live music or cocktail party chic. Sajal tells me that they are aiming to keep it student-friendly, which I'm not sure is compatible with the aim of making it a destination.</p>

<p>As for pricing, most entrees range from $16 to $25. I'm okay with steakhouse pricing, but that sets certain expectations. Does Maharaja rise above the average $18 meal based on taste and portion size?</p>

<p>Based on the only three items I tried, it is hard to be sure. Despite having only the appetizer be a "wow", I am impressed. You absolutely cannot beat the atmosphere here, and Sajal gives every sign of the savvy entrepreneur who will refine the menu towards greatness. I'm going to stretch Maharaja to 4.5 stars out of 5 based more on promise for the future than for where they are now, and look forward to returning to find out if I was right!</p>

<p>As for pricing, there is a 15% discount for students. So grab a student on hunger strike to come with you to Maharaja and pay.</p>

<p>So this is where you go to see Dan Aykroyd, whose daughter goes to Harvard. He likes the Crystal Head Vodka. And practically every foreign dignitary who comes to speak at Harvard stays at the Charles Hotel and may stop by. But don't say hello. Part of Noir's mystique is its darkness, its discretion. People don't come to Noir to be seen. They come to lose themselves in its chic and you are expected to play by the rules.</p>

<p>Because I don't drink, I don't review bars, and I almost walked into Noir and right out again on the assumption that they wouldn't have much of a menu, but the manager stopped me. Noir's kitchen is the same kitchen as Henrietta's Table, the tip-top brunch and dinner place you bring your high rolling consulting clients to, or your parents when they visit from out of town and you need to explain the C's and D's on your report card.</p>

<p>So later I've returned to Noir, here in the lower level of the Charles Hotel, to do a review. I like the swinging curtain of beads in the front. If the place weren't so classy I would stand there swooping my hand and watching them swing back and forth.</p>

<p>It's dark, noir dark, noir being French for "black", even though when I arrive at 5pm there is still some fading daylight. It's going to get darker. But Matt Joy, the general manager, points out that for those who want light they have an outdoor patio from April to October, which they'll open with a celebration including live music May 19th, 2011.</p>

<p>The space, which used to be a flower shop, was turned into a bar a decade ago, and has drifted into being more of a martini lounge lately. The upscale decor has 50 seats, including bar stools, and there are tables and circular booths for groups as well. They have black cocknail napkins that say Noir. Classy. Funky jazz and soul music plays on speakers. I feel a little out of place wearing jeans here.</p>

<p>Matt points out a pull-down screen and says that they play 1950-style movies here sometimes, without sound, as a backdrop. Thankfully there are no televisions in the place. This is an elite retreat, not a sports bar. They have a spring and summmer cocktail list that don't interest me because I don't drink.</p>

<p>They have a "Noir Bites" menu, a selection of three appetizers that are discounted when you buy a drink, and a separate food menu that's small, but covers every category from appetizers and soups to salads and dessert. In the middle, they have sandwiches and "grilled flatbreads", which is how they say pizza at Harvard.</p>

<p>I try the BLT Sandwich with Avocado on Sourdough Bread ($8). It's standard, but tasty, and comes with toasted bread. It's served juicy and warm, with bacon that Matt tells me is locally raised. It has a real ham smell to it, and it's thick, salty, and has a real chew. So it's not just a strip of grease like most bacon. The mayonaise is flavored like dijon mustard. It comes with All Natural Kettle Chips, the kind you buy in the supermarket, which are unnecessary. There's enough grease in the mayo and bacon to want chips as well. How about a side plate of carrot sticks?</p>

<p>The Warm Chocolate-Chip Cookie ($2) is worth the $2, and it's nice that it comes warm. I'm not sure why it was suggested to highlight the Noir menu.</p>

<p>Then all thought is erased by the Grilled Flatbread with Dried Peaches, Proscuitto, Argula, and Goat Cheese with Balsamic Reduction ($10). Holy Hamburgler and Mayor McCheese! So this is what brought Jesus back from the dead after 3 days.</p>

<p>Just the bread would be delicious on its own without any toppings. It's spicy, like an Indian naan, and Matt says they make their own dough on site. Then you add fantastic goat cheese from an organic farm in Western Massachusetts. Although it's somewhat small if you wanted a real dinner, you would not be here at Noir if you wanted a full dinner. The juicy toppings and soft pizza crust are then accessorized by bacon and dried peaches. As if that weren't enough, they then add a garnish, basically lettuce, with a balsamic vinagrette. The result is a warm, cheesy pizza that is competely hidden by layers of unique toppings that go great together. It's like a salad on a pizza.</p>

<p>So, is Noir more than just a bar? Can I rate it high in the pub/cafe tier? Can someone who doesn't drink enjoy Noir? Absolutely. Many bars edge into the world of restaurants, but sharing a kitchen with Henrietta's Table puts Noir on the map as far as a light dinner is concerned, although the menu is too small for a perfect 5 stars. Although the bar is small, and personally, I prefer to see the people I'm chatting with, so darkness isn't my thing, I'd love to enjoy their outdoor patio, one of the few in Harvard Square, to sit under the stars with some friends. I recommend it as a spot to come to with friends after the show, as an alternative to Finale (though note, it closes for food at 11pm).</p>

<p>And if you see Benicio Del Toro sitting darkly in the corner ("He came in and he wasn't even staying at the hotel!"), don't say hello.</p>

<td valign=top>

<p>Having just done a review of Life Alive, the new feel-good, health food cafe in Central Square, I was energized to do a review of Darwin's Ltd. Of course the name evokes Charles Darwin, who discovered evolution, and gives the place a feel-good cachet, as though over time humankind will both understand nature and live in harmony with it. Steve Darwin, who founded Darwin's Ltd in 1993, is even a descendant of a cousin of Charles Darwin, just like all of the famous scientist's own children. (That is an in-joke for you naturalists.)</p>

<p>So I was pretty pumped up to meet manager Mike McCullagh. Darwin's Ltd has two locations, on either side of Harvard Square. As well as being a sandwich shop and bakery, it is also a coffeehouse and grocery store that sells beer, wine, and produce. It makes for a colorful but ecletic interior. There are racks of goods in every direction and, with two supporting beams near the cash register, I can see that the queue to order sandwiches must create a traffic jam inside the store. In-between the two counters on either end of the store is a middle area with some limited seating. Although the staff can pick the music -- that can be dangerous -- the music that plays on speakers isn't loud and happened to be light rock and country when I visited.</p>

<p>Mike tells me with pride that they get their bread fresh every morning from Nashoba Brook Bakery, and that they are always sampling different meat providers and trying to find the best ingredients for their sandwiches.</p>

<p>Why does Cambridge need a destination like this? I ask. There are plenty of alternatives, after all.</p>

<p>Mike doesn't really have an answer, but says, "We have neighborhood tenure now," meaning that a community has formed around Darwin's Ltd that keeps it going. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't see much community. In the common space, each person sitting is hunched over a laptop, ignoring the others around them. Even at 4pm, the down time of the day, turnover is limited.</p>

<p>I ask Mike about the Starbucks Effect, where people take advantage of the space to squat for too long, making it hard for newcomers to find a seat. He says that there's nothing they can do about people who abuse the space. I <em>wouldn't</em> be surprised to hear that Darwin's Ltd had a policy against bugging loiterers (although I would prefer it, such a thing can backfire, socially), but I <em>am</em> surprised to hear that Mike doesn't know he has the right to ask them to leave. Any private establishment can ask anyone to leave for any reason at any time, and sometimes should.</p>

<p>I manage to get a bench seat (no table) and try a few of Mike's favorite sandwiches.</p>

<p>The Mount Auburn ($7.60), "smoked turkey, avocado, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and vinaigrette" has bread that's good-tasting, but falls in-between soft and hard. So with a thick sandwich like this it's definitely a chew to get through it and it tends to fall apart in your hands, partly because it's overly moist. The avocado was a nice surprise but the sandwich had too much mayo. Mayonnaise adds a creamy, smooth mouth feel. Avocado also adds a creamy, smooth mouth feel. I would have hoped for something spicy to offset this. The turkey is thinly sliced deli meat. As i said in my review of Finale, this choice always surprises me. Turkey sliced thin, especially if it comes from a "loaf" of processed turkey bits, can be slimy and too flimsy to bite into. The Mount Auburn sandwich is okay but not impressive.</p>

<p>The A.R.C. ($7.60), is "hot roast beef, cheddar, bar-b-que sauce, lettuce and tomato". It's served warm, and the bread is cut thinner, and it is really good bread, interesting and fresh. I expect a BBQ sandwich to have a strong smell, but it was bland, and like the Mount Auburn, I found it too moist, chaotic rather than thematic, and hard to eat without making a mess.</p>

<p>My favorite sandwich was The Hubbard Park  ($6.85), which is "hummus, avocado, apple, carrots, tomato, sprouts & honey mustard". Imagine that, me choosing the vegetarian sandwich first! (I love meat.) It tastes wholesome and pure, invigorating, and the apple and hummus combination really offset each other, while the sprouts add a healthy mouth feel. Unlike the other sandwiches I tried, it seemed a designed offering rather than a heap of ingredients.</p>

<p>I also sample the Florentine Cookie, a very thin wafer with bubbles of goodness, textured like a peanut brittle but very much with a carbohydrate body, covered on one side by a thin coat of chocolate. (Unfortunately, one cookie does not allow me to say anything broadly about their bakery items, but it was good.)</p>

<p>At this point I am struggling to love Darwin's Ltd the way I wanted to when I arrived. The sandwiches are fine but unexceptional. What about, as Mike suggested, the community?</p>

<p>I used my position as a journalist as an excuse to introduce myself to some of the laptop people. They confessed to having been seated for 40 minutes, 5 minutes, 2 hours, 40 minutes, and 4 hours respectively. Four hours! The gentleman in question told me that he loves to hang out at Darwin's Ltd because there are so many power outlets, and during this time he spent $9.50.</p>

<p>Others tell me: "I enjoy the ambiance, it's not a chain", and "It's a good escape from the hustle of Harvard". While nobody blew me off, one woman offered to write reviews for Events INSIDER, and while we spoke (a mini-interview), she wouldn't stop looking at her laptop. I mentioned this to her and she became angry, insisting that putting her attention elsewhere while someone speaks to her is perfect etiquette. I suggested she get a second opinion and she terminated her own interview with a dismissive, "Bye". Well, well.</p>

<p>One should not overly generalize, but I get the impression that the customers at Darwin's Ltd do <em>not</em> form a Merry Band of Brothers who laugh together, cry together, and, when seated alone at a two-person table, offer the empty chair to newcomers.</p>

<p>As one man who is a regular tells me, "It's like that quote from Cheers."</p>

<p>I say, "You mean, you want to go where everybody knows your name?"</p>

<p>He replies, "Oh, that's not it. Nobody knows my name here. I mean it's comfortable, unpretentious."</p>

<p>So, I'm not sure what to tell you about Darwin's Ltd. Some reviewers seem to write for the ego trip of shooting others down. That is not my style. I support local businesses and would love nothing more than for everyone to give Darwin's Ltd a try. But I cannot find an angle from which to recommend it over the alternatives in Harvard Square that I also want you to give a try, like bgood and Mr. Bartley's and Finale, all of which do great sandwiches in their respective tiers (fast food, pub, and restaurant).</p>

<p>So what is the mystery behind Darwin's Ltd? They seem to be popular with their existing community. What am I missing?</p>

<p>I suspect that, like Grendel's Den, the place may be skating, living off their existing goodwill and the people with too much inertia to go elsewhere, rather than growing and changing creatively to attract more customers. The shop is unsettlingly cluttered with signage and goods without any theme or design. The sandwiches seem thrown together without care (nobody's noticed the too-much-mayo problem, or that the BBQ sauce isn't spicy?).</p>

<p>Symbolic of the problem is the takeout menu. It's a single-sided, unfolded photocopy onto white paper, with a computer logo that's been resized so many times that it's become ugly and pixelated. In my opinion, the menu should be laid out carefully, double-sided, and professionally printed -- which in bulk is cheaper than photocopying. This would add both a touch of class and (by having more room to list items) would encourage sales in-house, by delivery, and through catering. With its limited seating, Darwin's Ltd is very much a takeout place. They should have an excellent takeout menu.</p>

<p>So... Darwin's Ltd starts with a great concept, and I like the small mural with the monkey. The name Darwin makes you feel good about nature and want to Save the Planet. I get all that. But based on their execution of this concept, I must give Darwin an underaverage rating in our Pub/Cafe tier.</p>

<p>You might meet the love of your life at Crema Cafe in Harvard Square. Liza Baer-Kahn met her fiance here. She's the co-owner who's run the place since 2008 with her old college friend Marley Brush. I spoke with them at 3pm on a weekday afternoon, but even between lunch and dinner, the place was packed.</p>

<p>As students, Liza and Marley spent one summer travelling Europe. There they saw cafes in Spain, France, and Paris with a charm that they wanted to bring here to Harvard Square, which has a lot of chains, but no independent cafe unless you include Leo's Diner, which isn't posh, or Darwin's, which is just outside Harvard Square and (as I reviewed last week) fails to impress.</p>

<p>Their interior design for Crema Cafe took inspiration from the existing space, with its natural brick walls and antique pine flooring. This place used to be an Au Bon Pain. It seats 60 people on two levels, with easy listening & bluegrass music playing on loudspeakers. With skylights, it's bright, and with the brick, tin plating, and real art on the walls, it balances between kitsch and cultured. It's professional, but not corporately devoid of character. There's a mirror on one wall which they've decorated with wooden shutters. Downstairs they have high tables, stools, and a diner-style counter.</p>

<p>Liza tells me her love story. "We call him 'the milkman' for fun, but he's really the distributor of our dairy and eggs," she says. "When we first opened, he would come in a lot, to drop off an invoice." He even forgot things on purpose as an excuse to come back and see her. It didn't take long for the employees to notice: "Why is our milkman helping us clean up and close the shop late at night?"</p>

<p>"He just used to show up a lot until I agreed to date him," Liza says, "He was very persistent." I would love to have heard that he popped the question here in the cafe, but regretfully it was in Maine's Arcadia National Park, where Liza's family has a tradition of going every year.</p>

<p>I have to ask the question I always ask at cafes: What about loiterers, those people who plunk down a laptop and make it impossible to sit with a friend to have a real conversation over tea?</p>

<p>Marley tells me that they've disconnected the wireless Internet just for that reason, and that their employees politely enforce a one-hour limit on tables. "Our bussers definitely notice." I'm glad to hear that, and it's another factor separating them from nearby Darwin's.</p>

<p>Everything at Crema Cafe is made homemade on site: they roast their own meats, make their own salad sauce, raise their own dough, and mix their own spreads for sandwiches. Every day they have a new soup and quiche special.</p>

<p>Let's try some food. Marley brings me a watermelon ade ($1.75 small, $2.55 large). You know, it's a lemonade without the lemon, and, um, with watermelon. Wow! It tastes just like a watermelon, not too sweet, with the fruitiness of a smoothie, except there's no ice: it's a juice drink.</p>

<p>I also sampled the tomato bisque. It's served refreshingly warm but I couldn't find anything unusual or special about it. Like any bisque it's so well-blended that it has no real texture, and perhaps because of that, no spice overtones popped out at me. The focaccia bread that it comes with though (and they bake it on site) is perfect: light and airy, a delightful chew, hearty.</p>

<p>I was offered the Turkey & Jicama Slaw ($7.50, but the photo is only a half-sandwich), a "house roasted turkey with jicama slaw, avocado, bacon, mayo, & ancho chili vinaigrette on a toasted homemade baguette," but I strongly suspect that I was actually served the Turkey & Jarlsberg Spread instead. Hmm.</p>

<p>This bread, which looks like a french loaf, is also made in-house, and it's also delicious, but it's hard to get my mouth around it and chew through. The sandwich is dominated by its bacon taste and while it has layers, there's perhaps too much of the mayonnaise-like spread, which is unncessary and along with the nicely crunchy (but not completely raw) vegetables hides the turkey meat entirely. That being said, once I found it the turkey is not the slippery deli meat that we're used to. It's savory and makes you stop for a moment to hold it in your mouth. Like all the sandwiches I try here, it's messy to eat. Perhaps it should be served with a plastic spoon to eat up the remnants.</p>

<p>The sweet potato chips are impressive. Made in-house, they're extremely thin, and come with no salt. It's definitely a unique taste. Even though they're deep fried they are not oily, so the flavor really comes through. You know what I mean. You dig into a bag of potato chips sometimes and after a few chips the oil and salt really make you regret having started. These chips aren't like that at all.</p>

<p>The Crema Grilled Chicken ($7) is the customer favorite, the signature sandwich, and it's my favorite, too, "grilled chicken breast with sliced avocado & zesty cotija cheese-corn spread, pressed on light sourdough." While the bread came too toastedly tough to bite into like a starving wolf (the way many of us eat on a quick lunch break), it's undeniably delicious. The hearty chicken breast meat is invigorating, a good chew that's a great match with the sauce. They added kernels of corn -- a master touch! -- and it's spicy enough to leave an aftertaste in your mouth.</p>

<p>I also try a vegetarian option, the Sweet Potato Sandwich ($7), "with avocado, green apple, sprouts, hummus & caramelized
shallot vinaigrette on toasted wheat." Like the Crema Grilled Chicken, I find the crust on the bread too tough, but it's an innovative mixture of mushy, mouthalicious potato versus the crisp citrusy apple. And they add sprouts to give it that extra heartland texture.</p>

<p>I try a French cannelle ($1.50, which despite the photo is served separate from the truffle). It's a honey-soaked pastry, like a pecan roll, and has a consistency and taste like a nut bread. It's not too sweet, and sized right to not spoil your diet. I'm afraid I didn't care for the truffle, which wasn't bad but must be an acquired taste. The molten chocolate core was too rich and the outer chocolate shell too bitter for me, and the powdered chocolate coating stayed on my hands. I didn't sample any of their other bakery products, but they have quite a selection.</p>

<p>Overall, I leave impressed. Crema Cafe is a remarkably fun and classy -- but not stuck-up -- place to get surprisingly good food in an atmosphere where you might actually get a seat, indoors or on one of the few outdoor patios in Harvard Square. As for Liza and her fiancee, I have to ask one more question. "So, has your fiancee been wooing you with a discount on dairy?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she replies with a smile. She's given new meaning to being "married to the business".</p>

<p>"Did you know that Cleopatra invented tabouli?" Amal Rizkallah asks me, the owner of Sabra. "And we use her recipe!" Here is the secret recipe from 2,000 years ago: cut parsley, onion, tomato, "crack wheat", olive oil, lemon juice, and pepper.</p>

<p>It turns out that she is just kidding, and besides, her place is Lebanese, not Egyptian like the Falafel Palace in Central Square. We're meeting in her hole-in-the-wall restaurant, call it a cafe, on Eliot Street in Harvard Square. </p>

<p>More tourists come to Lebanon than any other Arab country, she says with pride, partly because of the food, and also because of the ancient Roman ruins and natural caves. "And we have the best Lebanese food in the area," she says, although she hadn't heard of Garlic 'n Lemons in Allston, which I've also reviewed. But the two places are far enough apart not to be real competitors.</p>

<p>Amal's two brothers came to the US from Lebanon first, and then her husband came and she joined him at just 21 years old. Sabra was originally in Newton and now this is their second location. The place is not much to look at, she still has Christmas decorations up in April, and there are tourist bureau photographs of Lebanon on the walls, and a community post board. Crooning oldies play on a real radio, not loudspeakers.</p>

<p>All their food is made fresh daily, in house in a small open kitchen, and they're the only place around that serves chicken on a skewer, which you need a special machine permit for.</p>

<p>Amal offers me a "mixed plate with chicken and lamb", which is off the menu but a good way to sample a number of their foods without breaking the bank. (But doesn't show you the portion sizes or presentation of the meals, so I didn't take any photos.) Like most restaurant owners, she sits and watches me while I eat. I need to find a way to diplomatically get them to not do that.</p>

<p>Wow! The lamb could not be better. It's got that crisp outer layer like you'll find on a roast beef, with perfect meat chew while being spicy and unusual. It comes with a sauce that tastes like melted feta cheese (so that's how you make feta cheese even tastier!) but turns out is actually made from sesame seeds. Everything here is Halal, the muslim version of kosher, so it's totally non-dairy, except for the spinach pie. The garlic paste is creamy and not too potent, with olive oil, lemon juice, and fresh garlic, and their falafel is half fava beans & half hummus. They buy the chickpeas and fava beans and grind them fresh on site instead of using powdered beans like their competitors.</p>

<p>The tabouli I could almost believe came from Cleopatra's genius. They make it fresh almost every day, not weekly like other places, and you can really tell. The greens look fresh, not limp, and you can feel the texture and tickle of each leaf. With a sharp lemon juice mixed in, it's a real wake up, like a miniature salad with mint. It's potent enoguh that I'm glad it comes in a small portion.</p>

<p>The baked "kibee" is totally unique, like a ground meat pressed into one substance. It tastes like a falafel without the fried exterior, and it's somewhat dry, but generally served with tahini sauce. It's supposed to be served room temperature, but despite the great texture I'd prefer it warm. Anything that is fried or tastes fried is better warm.</p>

<p>The hummus is completely smooth, yet not a liquid - it's viscous, creamy, but somewhat bland. Yet the grape leaf was way too potent for me. The leaf really tastes like a leaf, like I'm eating it from a palm tree. That was a little too strange for me. The kofta tastes just like BBQ grilled beef, not overly spicy but with a fantastic texture. It tastes as complex as a sausage.</p>

<p>The pocket bread is generic, but I enjoyed the baklava, sweetened with rose water, which falls apart in your mouth. It's exceptionally flaky and sweet, and has a great mouth feel like honey toast but much smoother, with soft nuts and layers to the taste.</p>

<p>Overall, I don't know what to say. I'm very surprised by the quality of the food, but that's because the interior is downscale. Although Amal tells me that she wants to improve their interior but just doesn't have the cash, I notice that the walls are dirty. Cleaning them wouldn't cost anything, nor would taking down the Christmas decorations. When I run my fingers across the table, there's a texture like it's been cleaned by being wiped down instead of being scrubbed. I'm afraid when I first arrived I spotted Amal answering her cell phone in the middle of handling raw chicken, without washing her hands first. That's got to be either unsanitary or borderline to it.</p>

<p>So... I dont doubt Amal that Sabra has fresher food than competitors, and the portions I tasted were undeniably good. As a takeout place, I can reccommend Sabra, but as a cafe, I can only give it an average rating. Too bad I have been to Garlic 'n Lemons, which I think has spoiled me.</p>

<p>What happens when Bono walks into your restaurant? Nothing, until he's in the middle of eating and the other patrons suddenly realize who he is, the famous U2 rock star and philanthropist. (Maybe he wasn't wearing his trademark sunglasses.)</p>

<p>"That's when I had to come out from the kitchen and try to shoo people away," Theo Vallas tells me. "I apologized, but Bono said it was okay."</p>

<p>I've never noticed Zoe's before, except that it replaced the old 1950s futuristic Johnny Rocket, perhaps because it's at the basement level of a complex in-between Harvard and Central Squares, and I assumed it was a chain because of the corporate crispness of its logo. But I was wrong. It's a family restaurant, and Theo's family has a long history of running such places, back to his grandfather in 1951, who opened a place on Stuart Street in Boston and grew it to 4 restaurants. He enjoys the industry, and works hard at it and to find good staff. "You're as successful as the people around you" he says. There may be another generation of restauranteurs coming.</p>

<p>I can't help but mention the movie "My Crazy Greek Wedding" and Theo tells me, "All greek families are crazy." In 1988, presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis was supposed to come to one ot the family restaurants in Boston's Quincy Market, because he's Greek and wanted to be seen eating Greek food. So they were mobbed by secret service that day, but he never showed up.</p>

<p>Here at Zoe's Restaurant, Theo and I have met in a large place that seats more than 100, with greek music playing (think accordions and violins). The place retains the bright colors and layout of Johnny Rocket, which is mainly booth seating (with convenient coat hooks), but there is a row of stools along a diner counter as well. There's a nice bright window along one wall, with direct sunlight that I actually need to ask that the window shade be lowered so I can withstand. This would really wake you up on a Sunday morning. Countering the kitsch feel is an ugly neon beer sign and an unnecessary television -- although it's set to the news. The photos on the walls are generic, and there's an Internet music box. An advertisement in the front entrance says they have an iPhone app for ordering food.</p>

<p>"It's a neighborhood restaurant," Theo tells me, and it's especially good for families with kids. "I like to see regular customers return 3-4 times a week, that's what we're aiming for." They serve breakfast all day, and cater to everyone in the diversity of Harvard Square, from tourists to grad students to Natalie Portman, when she was studying at Harvard. They're known for their baked lamb, a signature dinner dish, and tourkei, an Easter bread.</p>

<p>I try the Baked Lam ($13), "tender lamb braised and then roasted in our special sauce, served with rice and your choice of Garden or Greek salad". It doesn't have a deep smell to it, but it comes with a salad that is perfect. By being perfectly dry, the salad is perfectly crisp and there's a delightfully sharp taste to the feta cheese. It doesn't need dressing.</p>

<p>I definitely approve of the rice, which is extra soft and poofy, and the smooth lamb falls apart in your mouth. It's not spicy, but it's a big meat portion that's hearty, and comes in a red sauce like a meatball sauce that (see the photo) is greasy enough for some oil to separate out from.</p>
  
<p>The Turkey Reuben ($8) is "turkey, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing served on grilled dark rye bread". The sweet potato fries it comes with are yummy, caterpillar cut, and the toasted rye has a great texture. Although the turkey meat is sliced thin, it has a real chew to it, the opposite of slick almost slimy deli meat, thank goodness. I greatly appreciated the real pickle, a really crunchy, deep tasting pickle of high quality.</p>

<p>The menu has real dinner food, too. This is definitely more than just a diner. The Saganaki ($13 with shrimp), is "a fragrant tomato and feta cheese sauce served over rice or pasta", and it's remarkable -- a wow! -- with feta cheese in the sauce. (Although you can also see the extra oil in this sauce.) It tastes completely unique, like a red sauce that I've never had before. Is that vinegar I'm tasting?</p>

<p>I'm also wowed by the sweet potato pancakes, with a potent smell that lifts you right up. It's quite sweet, like a pumpkin pie, and you can really tell that the maple syrup is real. (Theo says that despite the cost he always serves real maple syrup.) And to me it didn't need any butter, despite the fancy side.</p>

<p>I'm not so keen on the french toast. The "crunchy" variety came with uninteresting bread and bits of nuts and cereals that looked like they would have a crunch, but didn't. The "greek" variety I just found empty, tasting very puffy, despite the powdered sugar, like eating a pastry donut with too much air in it.</p>

<p>I'm also not won over by the Zoe's Omelette ($8.79), "tomatoes, baby spinach, buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil." Although it has a great smell, and I can see the big ingredients, the spinach & tomato, I can't taste the chunks when I eat. The cheese is tasteless, and the omelette is wet inside, not from runny eggs but from the vegetables being washed, I suppose. In an egg dish any wetness is too much, to me, and the toast was cold. Although admittedly I let the plate sit, I wonder if Zoe's heats their plates. Still, the hash browns are delicious, not greasy.</p>

<p>Theo made it up to me, though, by serving me the Santa Fe omelette instead ($8.79), "chicken sausage, onions, spinach and jack cheese, topped with salsa" which brought me back. The chicken sausage is sweet, with has apples and syrup built-in, and it's served piping hot, with pieces of chopped onion that while tiny have a real crunch to them. Like all omelettes, it's a very heavy meal, yet I appreciate the generous portion of this and everything I tried at Zoe's</p>

<p>On the way out, I took home a sample of the apple pie, and heated it up at home. Unfortunately, I found it undercooked. The crust was still doughy and the apples, well, some people like their apple pie to have apples with a bite, but I'm in the applesauce camp. I confirmed that they make their own apple pie instead of buying it from a bakery, and presumably everything else in their dessert display case is made in-house as well.</p>

<p>I would give Zoe's a lower rating as a restaurant, which it resembles, but with the brunch emphasis, diner seating, and neon beer sign it really belongs in our pub/cafe tier (<a href="/restaurants_in_boston/about-our-ratings.html" target=_blank>about our ratings</a>) so I'll give it a solid 4 stars. With a bright atmosphere and some remarkable meals (despite a couple of disappointments) I am glad to recommend not just a brunch but a lunch or dinner at Zoe's. And if you are lucky, you may get to meet Zoe herself. Zoe's Restaurant is named for Theo's daughter, a cute 7-year-old who has a habit of walking from table to table introducing herself to guests with, "Hello, this is my restaurant!"</p>

<p>Tommy Doyle's is haunted. At least, that's what Garrett Tingle tells me, the group general manager of the Harvard Square location, a free-standing building that was formerly the ancient "Hyde-Taylor House", once a schoolhouse, once a private home, and once the seat of the House of Blues.</p>

<p>Garrett's a third-generation Cantabrigian, and despite his humbly covering it up with a long-sleeved shirt, clearly has the arms to bench press a car. He's been working in restaurants since he was 18, and got a job working the bar at Tommy Doyle's, choosing the place (but owners Alan O'Sullivan & Peter Woodman did not know him) because it was his mother's trivia place and she was their favorite customer.</p>

<p>"So, how is this place haunted?" I ask.</p>

<p>"No matter what big event we have," he says, "something in this building will shut down inexplicably, but then will come up with no notice." And his staff late at night have definitely had sightings of figures, especially downstairs: strange noises and lights going on and off. I wonder if they might want to have NSTAR check their electrical transformer. But who knows? Maybe Sam Adams is keeping an eye on his beer.</p>

<p>Tommy Doyle's has other locations: in Kendall Square, Cambridge, in Hyannis on Cape Cod, and in Newton (which has a <a href="http://tommydoylesnewton.com/" target=_blank>separate website</a> for some reason).</p>

<p>Harvard Square has a diverse crowd of students, professionals, "locals", and tourists, and Garrett is proud that despite the Irish theme of the pub, he gets all types. "You can't pigeon hole us," he says. He points out the small crowd behind us on the 2nd floor watching an international soccer game on a projection TV screen. "And just the other day we did Latin Night for the Harvard Mexico Club," he says. "Last week, the President of Belgium came here, and we had a 21st birthday party."</p>

<p>Garrett tells me that it's very important to him for Tommy Doyle's to be involved with the community, and from his good-natured demeanor, I believe it. They raise money for local groups, doing for example a Mothers Day 5K Race that begins and ends at one of the Tommy Doyle's branches. They give the space away free and offer a portion of bar sales to the charity. They host live music 5 nights a week, but the bar has three levels, so noise is not that big a problem, and you can still have a quiet conversation if you choose the right seat.</p>

<p>Inside, the pub's walls are a dirty yellow color and the brown wood and earth tones we expect from an Irish pub abound. The place has low lighting that leads to privacy and an interior that with kindness I could call "comfortable". But I can't help but notice the beer placeholders, the thick wooden tables marked from use, and rips in the couch we're sitting on, snug in a corner where a group of 6 could be seated. Televisions line the walls and only some of the old-timey photos stuck everywhere (even on the ceiling) are real. There's even a touch of grafiti on the wall by my seat, where from the grease stains I would guess that nobody's scrubbed there in some time.</p>

<p>I suggest that Garrett doesn't lack refinement, but that the lived-in theme is a deliberate design that adds character, and he agrees. His customers like Tommy Doyle's to resemble a lived-in home more than an overly-crisp corporate decor like at Quizno's. I'm pleased to find, however, elegant touches like catsup that comes served on the side rather than in a Heinz bottle, drizzle over many of the plates (see the photos), and each table has a small vase of flowers.</p>

<p>While their Irish stew and Shepard's stew are authentic, just like the home country, Tommy Doyle's works hard at being inclusive and is far from pretentious about cuisine. Karaoke night is Wednesday, and their executive chef is a non-Irishman, because "people who are passionate about what we do here" is more important than ethnic loyalty. The chef, Estuart Rojas, has a fantastic Latin moustache. He comes out to say hello and sits for a chat while Garrett attends to other business. After schooling at the Chicago Culinary Institute, Estuart worked at Boston's Top of the Hub restaurant in the Prudential Center and brings some of that fancy panache to Tommy Doyle's. His top-selling dish is fish & chips, and among his talents is stuffing a reuben sandwich into a chicken. I didn't even know that was possible.</p>

<p>He has several dishes brought out to me -- I'll end up with leftovers for a week! Although the prices aren't discounted, they meals come as large portions, and they come on simple white plates, the same presentation style as the Top of the Hub. Tommy Doyle's makes everything in house, even their own sauces. Estuart is funny because he sits staring at me while I eat, as though trying to read my mind with each bite. But his attention is also partly on the game. When the crowd roars, and he thinks I'm distracted writing a note, he can help but peek over his shoulder to the televisions above the bar. But then I have his attention again. "So what do you think?" he asks.</p>

<p>I think that the staff here at Tommy Doyle's means business. They're clearly determined to make this the best place it can be. I'm very impressed by their earnestness. I spend a lot of time on people in my reviews because I find time and time again that good people create good food, service, and atmosphere. So my hopes are high. Let's eat!</p>

<p>The Coleannon Cakes (2 for $8) is an appetizer, "seared potato cakes with scallions, cabbage, and garlic butter". They are absolutely smooth, a soft mashed potato with a pure mouth feel, and come breaded and possibly fried. Although they come with cheese that might stop your heart, but they are hearty, not greasy. And they're topped with a delicious salad with hot peppers that has no need for dressing.</p>

<p>The Reuben-Stuffed Chicken ($14) is "chicken breast stuffed with corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut. Served with a curry sauce, mashed potatoes, and Irish-style sauteed cabbage." That curry smell is potent even before I read the ingredients on the menu, and I love boiled cabbage... um, <em>sauteed</em> cabbage... and it comes braised with chicken stock. The chicken and corned beef are solid, and have a real meat bite to them, but the chicken was slightly rubbery and may have been underdone. Unfortunately, with 8 dishes to sample, I let this one sit and the potato became cold. I can easily see a customer letting a dish sit for a while, busy in conversation with friends. I wonder if Tommy Doyle's heats their plates.</p>

<p>The Hill 16 Burger ($11) comes "topped with Irish bacon and cheddar cheese." The fries were limp and greasy, but I enjoyed the burger. What I mean is that I enjoyed the meat, which came juicy and spicy and didn't need the toppings, which were uninteresting and seemed plopped on -- the bacon was sort of a ham -- as was the bun. Of course, I understand. Estuart tells me that me that upscale rolls are very expensive and go bad in 24 hours. Unfortunately, I found the cheese uninteresting, too.</p>

<p>The Stuffed Pork Tenderloin ($15) is "packed with sundried tomatoes, spinach, and Provolone cheese, served with a port glaze, mashed sweet potatoes, and haricot verts." (Haricot verts? It sounds like somebody fell asleep at the keyboard at the end there, or maybe they patrons won't read that far in.) Now this is more like it! The pork is pure,  it really is the other white meat, with a chewy center and the sundried tomatoes chew a bit like cranberries. The sweet potatoes are a nice touch.</p>

<p>The Ribeye steak ($15) is not a menu item but a special, "grilled to temperature, topped with a red wine demi glaze with creamy fingerling potatoes and grilled asparagus." It's really tender, in a delicious sauce, a wine demiglaze, that's really good. The asparagus doesn't become stringy and has a good crunch. It's an interesting presentation because the wine glaze comes on top of the meat, and then below that is a spicy cream sauce, with potatoes on the bottom.</p>

<p>The Shrimp & Spinach Stuffed Ravioli ($15), is "raviloi stuffed with spinach, garlic, and peppers, sauteed with shrimp and Spanish olives in a light cream sauce." This one's my favorite so far, with layers to the creaminess and a sweet but not overpowering cream sauce. Every spoonful is slightly different and it's a real treat to get a seafood dish at an Irish pub.</p>

<p>The Slow-Roasted Lamb Shank ($17) comes "in a red wine demi glaze with mashed potatoes and haricot verts." More haricot verts. I'm going to have to come up speed on these verts, obviously. Apparently it's French for green beans. Oh! I like green beans. Holey moley. Now this is a big chunk of lamb, with a bone right through it! It breaks apart in your mouth and you just want to savor the meat, and it comes with the most 'alcohol' tasting of the wine sauces I tried.</p>

<p>The Statler Chicken ($14) is another special off the menu, "pan seared with herbs and topped with a Madeira glaze with roasted red bliss potatoes and sauteed spinach." It's got a fantastic smell and exceptionally moist chicken. This is my new favorite, the only meal at Tommy Doyle's that got me to "Wow!" The spinach is really flavorful and the russet potatoes are just right consistency, not crunchy but not soft.</p>

<p>This review makes me think of my review of the Rosebud Diner. The food was okay but the owners bragged in a way that said they were either arrogant or clueless (I chose clueless). I get the opposite feel from Tommy Doyle's. Although only one meal wowed me, they have some great items and I can tell from the earnestness of the chef and manager that <em>they really care</em>. So they get points for that. I don't doubt that they have great customer service, they love to build community, and they are eager for feedback -- even when there's a big soccer match on TV.</p>

<p>That being said, Tommy Doyle's definitely goes in my pub/cafe tier rather than a restaurant tier. I knocked them from 4 stars to 3.5 stars for the worn appearance of the place and the mild smell in the basement bathroom, which is covered with grafiti. It's clean, but there's only so much you can do when (as I confirmed with one of the servers) people vomit there twice a week. Still, I know from experience that the Kendall Square location is more upscale, so I am pleased to give Tommy Doyle's a well deserved 4 stars in Kendall Square and 3.5 stars in Harvard Square. Think of it like this. So many pubs (notably nearby Grendel's Den) claim to create a community and Tommy Doyle's really outperforms there, with plenty of out-of-the-way niches. If you want a restaurant, fine, go to a restaurant. If you want an overperforming pub to become a regular at, Tommy Doyle's is a solid choice.</p>

<p>Based right in downtown Concord is a historic building dating from 1716 that has been a hotel since 1889. Not only can you eat at their famous restauant, if you come at the right time (for example, brunch) you'll get to meet a historical re-enactor to teach you about history. Now that's creative. I had the pleasure of meeting manager Shay Hoos and sampling some of the food.</p>

<p>The prices are upscale but the experience and food is unbeatable. Let's start with the venue itself, which while renovated carries that dark wood feeling of colonial times, with lanterns along the walls. It's easy to feel the presence of Henry David Thoreau, who spent two years there while a student at Harvard. Other have indeed claims to see actual ghosts on site -- but not in the dining room! The place is large and brightly lit. It's an upscale, comfortable atmosphere but not a stuffy one. After all, travelers pass through here in whatever state of fatigue. So you won't feel left out in casual clothing. Soft jazz music plays, so quiet as to be almost audible.</p>

<p>While you wait for your order, free bread, including corn bread, which is fantastic, with just the right level of sugar and mouth feel. I found the brie appetizer a touch too cheesy, but definitely unique, with its balsamic drizzle. The pear salad was just the right kind of exotic: interesting, unusual, but still accessible. It comes with cream cheese and pine nuts!</p>

<p>The restaurant often serves specials, such as their Thanksgiving buffet, which has a prime rib and turkey carving station. Oh, Colonial Inn. You had me at "turkey carving station". (Actually you had me a lot earlier at Louisa May Alcott.) They serve some real colonial classics, such as pot pie at  pot roast, and their most popular meals include a tomahawk veal chop, rabbit & quail, and the Boston strip steak. The veal chop is called "tomahawk" by the axe head way it looks when it is cut and served.</p>

<p>The strip steak, had a wonderful mouth feel, with that meat chew that I crave even more than the meat taste, and not stringy at all. The pot roast melted in my mouth, perfectly soft, and served with mashed potatoes that were not too fatty or rich. The clam chowder was also unusual, seasoned strongly, delicious, not too thick, and not too milky.</p>

<p>I'm hardly a soft touch, but the experience at the Colonial Inn can only be described as perfect. The atmosphere and service were luxurious, and each meal came with that hard-to-find combination of unique, but delicious and accessible -- not too strange or so full of sweet and fat that you can't finish. I am glad to give Concord's Colonial Inn a full 5 out of 5 stars.</p>

<p>Let's face it. Some reviewers get caught up in trying to impress their art school buddies. They complain about shallow characters in action movies, or name-drop exotic foods like creme de la creme creme, while thinking: <em>I'm so smart!</em></p>

<p>We have a different approach at Boston Events Insider. We review restaurants <em>so you can make decisions</em> about where to eat. And we are you. Our reviewers haven't been to culinary school. We just "insiders" who love to discover the best places and then tell our friends.</p>

<p>Our ratings are based on expectations and surprises:</p>

<ul>
<ol>1. Let's say it's "Korean BBQ". What would you expect and assume?</ol>

<ol>2. Go to Joe's Korean Smokehouse. Was this Korean BBQ place better or worse than expected?</ol>
</ul>

<p>That's why an average pizza shops is rated 3, and an average fancy restaurant rated 3, too. It's all relative to their direct competitors. To be clear:</p>

<br>
<p>Generally speaking, we break down restaurants into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <b>Fast food place</b> is very commercialized. It has no table service and sometimes no tables. A hole in the wall.</li>
<li><b>A Cafe / Pub</b> has tables and may or may not have table service, but the emphasis is on socializing rather than an intimate experience. So there may be televisions or a bar that dominate the space.</li>
<li><b>A Restaurant</b> is a sit-down experience where you don't have to dress up or pay more than $25 a plate. They don't have televisions.</li>
<li><b>A Dining Experience</b> is a bit of a theater where they not only feed you but make you feel like one of the elite, with cloth napkins and salad forks. They don't have a buffet or salad bar.</li>
</ul>
